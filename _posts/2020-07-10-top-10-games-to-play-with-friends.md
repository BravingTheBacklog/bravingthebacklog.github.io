Whether it's online or local, multiplayer with friends can be exceptionally fun.
I've probably spent more total time on single-player games than multiplayer
ones, but there are still several games that I've had a blast playing with
friends over the years.

Here are my top 10 favorites!

## 10. {% include game.html game="Overcooked" platform="" %}

*Also available on:* PS4, Xbox One, Switch

This game is a fun local-coop game where you and your friends man several
bizarre kitchens with the goal of filling as many orders as possible during the
time limit. The time limit is just a few minutes, so this is one you could pick
up and play quickly. During those few minutes, things can get really hectic
though! As you get further into the game, the hazards in the kitchen become more
and more difficult, and it'll really test your communication skills when things
get tough!

## 9. {% include game.html game="Deep Rock Galactic" platform="" %}

*Also available on:* Xbox One

It's only recently that I've started playing Deep Rock Galactic, but *wow* is a
fun time with friends. Its online cooperative gameplay supports up to 4 players
as you take on missions with several different types of objectives and explore
procedurally generated caves. You play as dwarves, so the mining is a
significant focus during the missions, and the terrain is fully destructible.
You can mine wherever you want on the hunt for resources, all while keeping an
eye out for the alien life native to the caves. Swarms of insects will happen
though, and the music that plays when they do is pretty great!

Mining and shooting swarms of alien insects with friends is a feeling like no
other!

## 8. {% include game.html game="Age of Empires II Definitive Edition" platform="" %}

I put Definitive Edition here, but any version of this real-time strategy
classic is a safe bet for a fun game with friends. This game was my first
experience with a LAN party, where my group of friends rounded up laptops and
plugged into a network switch to play 8-player, 4v4 conquest games. That was
with the original release on CD, but I've since played the HD version on Steam
and most recently the Definitive Edition, and all of them offered great
multiplayer fun!

## 7. {% include game.html game="Mario Party 5" platform="" %}
 
The iconic, mini-game-filled, Mario-themed board game series: Mario Party. If
you haven't played a Mario Party game before, I'd definitely recommend checking
out one of the GameCube entries in the series! They hold up well, and offer a
wildly entertaining experience for up to 4-players.

This entry could be replaced with any Mario Party of your choice. I almost
picked Mario Party 6, but 5 has a lot of nostalgia for me. I really liked that
it has the Star Spirits from Paper Mario in it on the main menu, and the
collection of mini-games is solid.

## 6. {% include game.html game="Stikbold A Dodgeball Adventure" platform="" %}

Stikbold is a game about dodgeball. It's packed full of light-hearted charm,
bright colors, and there's both an extremely fun co-op campaign and a free
battle mode for up to 4 players. I didn't realize until now, but it's very
fitting that Stikbold released on April Fool's Day. It's a perfect release date
for a zany game like this!

## 5. {% include game.html game="Halo Reach" platform="" %}

*Also available on:* Xbox One, PC

Local Halo matches are extremely fun for a group of four friends (or more if
you're using System Link) regardless of which game in the series you're
playing. The reason Halo: Reach gets my pick is simple: Forge World. Playing
Forge mode and building stages together was something my friends and I spent
*hours* doing after the release of Reach. Were any of the stages good? Probably
not, but building them and messing around playtesting them was a ton of fun! If
that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, there's also the campaign, which can be
played through entirely in co-op, or the wave defense Firefight mode.

With the release of Halo: Reach on Steam, I've been playing it again lately with
friends, and it's still a lot of fun! Unfortunately, Forge isn't yet available
on PC, and multiplayer is online or LAN only, without any split-screen
multiplayer options.

## 4. {% include game.html game="Minecraft" platform="" %}

*Also available on:* Android, iOS, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, Switch, and more

I was thinking of the original Java Edition for PC when I wrote this, but you
can have a lot of fun with split-screen co-op on many of the console editions of
Minecraft too! This is exactly what my friends and I used to do in the Xbox 360
version, and we had a blast building worlds together in split-screen. Whether
you're playing on a Minecraft server online or enjoying some local co-op,
Minecraft is an excellent experience with friends.
 
## 3. {% include game.html game="Mario Kart 64" platform="" %}

Mario Kart 64 makes my list over the other entries in the series for one reason:
battle mode. I always enjoyed the balloon battle mode, where up to 4 players
face off in one of 4 small arena, and the goal is to be the last one standing.
Using items you'll pick up around the stage, you aim to eliminate your
competition. My siblings and I played battle mode as kids, and recently I played
it again with friends and it was every bit as fun as I remembered!

If you're looking for a good kart racing experience with friends, I think the
later Mario Kart games are better. But 4 player battle mode in Mario Kart 64 is
a great time!

## 2. {% include game.html game="Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" platform="" %}

Any of the Super Smash Bros. games are great to play with friends, but I've
picked Ultimate since it has the most content. There are more characters and
stages than any game in the series before it, and that allows for tons of
options. Fighting against your friends as beloved video game characters never
gets old!

4 player battles are what I'm most used to, but in more recent Smash Bros. games
you can have up to 8 player battles if you have enough controllers and/or
consoles!

## 1. {% include game.html game="Crawl" platform="" %}

*Also available on:* PS4, Xbox One, Switch

Crawl is best when you have 4 players, and that's actually the only way I've
played it but you can have bots fill in the empty player slots as well. If you
can get a group of 4 people together to play it though, it's *fantastic*. The
gameplay consists of 1 human hero and 3 spirits, and the human's goal is to make
it down through several floors of randomly generated dungeons and defeat a boss
at the end. The human is controlled by one player, and each spirit is controlled
by another. The twist is that the spirits can possess various traps in the
dungeon and summon and control monsters, and if one of them kills the human then
they become the human, and the player who was human becomes a spirit. So
gameplay cycles between temporarily cooperating with a few of your friends to
take down the human, but if you become the human then the tables turn on you and
the ones you were just cooperating with are now trying to take you down.

It's a really fun concept, and I've spent a few evenings with friends playing
several rounds of Crawl, and each of them has been an incredibly fun success,
probably the most fun I've had with a local co-op game!
