Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

**Spoiler warning:** I show and talk about some bosses from **Shin Megami
Tensei: Strange Journey Redux**, so if you want to go into the game completely
blind, you should skip this post. There are no story spoilers though!

### Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux *(3DS)*    {#ShinMegamiTensei:StrangeJourneyRedux}

For the last two weeks, I've continued Strange Journey Redux, and I'm nearing
the end now! I've covered *a lot* of ground in that time, and I'm surprised at
how much I've enjoyed the game since I'm not usually into first-person dungeon
crawlers.

As expected, the dungeon layouts become a lot more involved as you progress.
There's some trial and error involved finding the right path, with things like
teleporter mazes where the wrong one sends you backwards. These kinds of
gauntlets usually have a few shortcuts you can unlock to save time though, so if
you need to leave the dungeon to heal, or if you take the wrong teleporter and
get sent back, you can get back to where you were more quickly. You can also
save and take a break at any time during the dungeons, which is really nice! All
of this combines to create dungeons that are engaging, requiring a bit of
memorization to get around.

There are a few especially tough parts that require a little patience. One of
the later dungeons is particularly infamous for this, and I definitely went in
circles there a few times before I figured it out. I don't care for the Dark
Zones either, which are areas of total blackness that you have to navigate
blind, and they don't get filled in on the map either. Most of the time their
layout is pretty simple and you just have to turn a few corners in the dark or
find an exit door. Later on, you get upgrades that let you see in these dark
areas, and allowing them to appear on the map. This whole mechanic was present
in SMT 1 too, and it's a lot nicer and more forgiving in this game! Overall, I
like the dungeon design in Strange Journey, I think it works well.

Of course, as you're dungeon crawling there are random encounters, but the
encounter rate is quite comfortable. It never felt too high to me. You can also
get equipment to lower the encounter rate (or increase it, if you're grinding or
something), which definitely helps when backtracking through an earlier dungeon
or trying to focus on exploration.

Not that I mind the encounters though - the battle system has grown on me even
more! It's really satisfying when you have a full team that matches your
alignment, you hit the enemy's weakness, and you unleash a full power co-op
attack. This does a ton of damage, and you can mow down regular enemies with
ease.

While normal enemies aren't much of a challenge anymore, there have been some
*tough* bosses. Most notably: Ouroboros. That was a *tough* boss. You have to
fight it twice, and both fights are challenging for different reasons. The 1st
time, it automatically heals by a decent amount each turn, so you have to deal
consistent damage every turn to wear its health bar down, while keeping your
party healthy. In the 2nd fight, Ouroboros doesn't heal, but it has nastier
attacks, like one that damages the whole party and causes random status
ailments. You can protect your party against status ailments for a few turns at
a time by using the Brave Heart skill, but the boss has a nasty habit of waiting
until your protection wears off and *then* inflicting the entire party with
ailments. I did a little grinding to prepare for this fight, but what helped
more was rethinking my strategy, and paying attention to how the boss AI reacted
to buffs and debuffs. Eventually, I won. I don't have any more to say about it
specifically, I guess I've repressed those memories.

I won't talk about the plot much to avoid spoilers, but it's good! I've chosen
the Law route, and while I feel bad about what my character ends up doing in
this route, and about the ultimate goal he's now pursuing...it makes for an
interesting story!

I'm in what I think is the final dungeon of the game now, so I expect to finish
it in the next week, unless I get really sidetracked with side quests or fusing
demons. Since this is Strange Journey Redux, there's an additional optional
dungeon, as well as a new character who shows up early in the game to introduce
the player to the new content. I've basically ignored the new content since it's
my first playthrough, but if I ever do another playthrough maybe I'll check it
out!
