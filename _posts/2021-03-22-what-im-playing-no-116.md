### Persona 5 Strikers *(PS4)*    {#Persona5Strikers}

Continued my Merciless New Game+ playthrough and witnessed some more Phantom
Thief shenanigans, and the cutscenes I watched were just as great as the first
time around!

I finally got the platinum trophy for this game by unlocking all the other
trophies. Like I mentioned last time, the last thing I had to do was max out all
the Bond skills, which also meant getting the Bond level to 99. Initially, I was
replaying through the story to gain these points, but then I read online that it
was faster to fight Dire Shadows. These are optional challenge bosses, but with
my New Game+ Personas and everyone in the party at level 99, they were pretty
easy even on Merciless difficulty. I had defeated them in my first playthrough
on Normal difficulty as well, but they were a lot harder back then! I feel a
little bad for the Nebiros Dire Shadow. My team pummeled him so many times. I
chose him for grinding since he was the closest one I found to a fast travel
point, and we must have fought him at least a dozen times to grind up to Bond
level 99. Eventually, I reached max Bond level! With that, my journey with
Persona 5 Strikers is at an end. Now that I have all the trophies, I feel
content with my 69 hours with the game. I don't plan on finishing my New Game+
playthrough, at least not right now.

### Radiata Stories *(PS2)*    {#RadiataStories}

This is an action RPG for the PlayStation 2 developed by tri-Ace. tri-Ace are
known primarily for the Star Ocean series, but have occasionally released
unrelated games like Radiata Stories. Radiata Stories follows the adventures of
Jack Russell, son of a famous member of the Radiata Knights. Jack leaves home to
follow in his father's footsteps and join the Radiata Knights. To join, you have
to pass a selection trial where you duel another candidate. When Jack sees that
his opponent in the trial is a young girl, he assumes his fight will be a walk
in the park. Things don't go as he expects though, as his opponent, Ridley
Silverlake, has been training for the knights from a very young age. Despite
losing the duel, Jack is still admitted to the Radiata Knights at the insistence
of Prime Minister Larks, who believes that Jack has a lot of potential due to
his father's legacy. With that, the player's wild ride through Jack's adventure
begins.

When I started Radiata Stories, I didn't realize how genuinely amusing it would
be, especially the opening. Jack is an energetic and overconfident protagonist,
who rarely avoids speaking his mind. This leads to some pretty funny exchanges
from time to time. A lot of the character reactions are really over-the-top and
hammy too. There are some jokes that don't land and just come off as awkward,
but all-in-all it's pretty funny.

<figure class="half">

Battles are pretty simple, the mechanics aren't as deep as in something like
Tales. Before battle, you set up your combo based on the skills you've learned
for your currently equipped weapon type. In battle, you mash the normal attack
button and Jack automatically goes through the skills you assigned. You can also
spend Volty Points to use Jack's special attack. You gain Volty Points by
attacking enemies with regular attacks. Naturally, you can guard and use items
as well. You only directly control Jack in battle, but you can also give orders
to your allies in battle, and also have them join you in various formations
called Lines, each of which bestows some additional benefit. It's a fun system,
not as fast-paced as a lot of other action RPGs, but I don't mind that
personally.

The part of Radiata Stories I was most looking forward too, and probably the
part I've also enjoyed the most, is recruiting friends. After a certain point in
the game, you're given free reign to take on missions and explore the city and
surrounding areas at your leisure. You also have to build your own party by
befriending people. Some of them are easy, you just talk to them and they join
you, assuming you've met the requirements like being a certain level, seeing a
certain special event, or having a certain number of friends already. Others are
more difficult to recruit, and require you to solve a problem for them first,
like finding their missing contact lens.

</figure>

Everyone has their own schedules too, and go around town tending to their
business each day. It's sort of like a less intricate Majora's Mask, since every
has the same schedule each day. However, they might all have the same schedule
each day, but there are a *lot* more NPCs than in Majora's Mask. 14 hours in and
I was *still* stumbling across new townspeople that I hadn't met before! It's
cool learning about different characters' schedules bit by bit, and getting a
better feel for the city. Most characters don't have much to say, and go through
the same dialogue each day depending on the time of day, but that's
understandable given how many characters there are in the game. The city is also
*huge*, and I definitely had to refer to the map a lot when learning my way
around!

Early on, I spent a lot of time running around town talking to everyone, trying
to figure out how to recruit each person on my own. That took a *long* time
though, so eventually I cut *way* back on my obsessive need to recruit everyone.
I've been referring to a guide for specific characters since then whenever I am
curious if I'm on the right track to recruit someone, or if it's possible for me
to recruit them at all. From the guide, I've already learned that I've missed
out on a specific event that's required to recruit some of the most powerful
characters in the late-game...so at least I won't have to waste time trying to
figure out how to recruit them on my own. Anyway, I feel that I've built up a
respectable list of friends. Some don't seem like they'd be useful at all in
battle, and I haven't tried them out. But others, like Tony, joined me at a
pretty high level relative to what level Jack was at the time, and have been a
staple of my party since.

I'm up to 43 of 177 friends recruited, and I'm starting to feel a little bit
fatigued from trying to keep everyone's recruitment requirements straight. It
would definitely help if there was some way to see what "quests" you'd started,
but there's not a quest log or anything so you just have to try and remember. Or
write it down somewhere, I suppose. I've been doing the former, but I tend to
forget what I need to do for one person after I've gotten requests from several
others afterward. I'm looking forward to seeing where the main story goes, it
seems like it's going to start *really* going places soon!
