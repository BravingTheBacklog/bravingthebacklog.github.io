I played a lot of games in 2019, but only few of them came out this
year. I've been doing a lot of catching up on the backlog, and that's a
really good feeling! With all the excellent games I played in 2019, it
was tough to pick my ten favorites!

<!--more-->

After reflecting back on the experiences I had, I managed to narrow it
down to the ten in this list. Of course, these are my personal picks
based on what I played. These are by no means objective choices!

To keep things interesting, I decided to limit my choices to one game
per series. This really only affects a few games in the list, but I
didn't want the list to get stale if a series popped up on it more than
once. Also, I'm only including games that are primarily single player
experiences. Even though I really enjoyed playing Super Smash Bros.
Ultimate this year, it doesn't really fit that criteria, so it won't be
on the list. All that said, on to the list itself!

## 10. {% include game.html game="Bayonetta" platform="" %}

I went in not really sure if I would enjoy Bayonetta. Largely due to her
inclusion in Super Smash Bros., I wanted to learn more about the character and
series, and decided to play it based on that and the fact that the first game
was available on Steam and I was able to get it on a really good sale. I was
blown away by how fun this game was. The combat flows incredibly smoothly, and
it's fun to slowly get better at it. The irreverent tone, sense of style, and
humor add onto that to create a truly unique experience, one I'm very glad I
found time for this year.

## 9. {% include game.html game="Parasite Eve" platform="" %}

When I heard about how Parasite Eve blends some survival horror elements with a
sort of action turn-based battle system, I was intrigued. When I played it for
myself, I was hooked. Why hadn't I played Parasite Eve sooner? The plot and
battle mechanics are hugely entertaining, and I recommend anyone with access to
this game give it a shot! Buying it digitally shouldn't break the bank, and it's
a relatively short experience that is well worth the time.

## 8. {% include game.html game="Earthbound" platform="" %}

Just like Parasite Eve, I don't know why I didn't play through
Earthbound sooner. Unlike Parasite Eve though, I'd started Earthbound a
few times in the past, but never made it further than Threed. This
year, I finally stuck through to the end with Earthbound, and I am so
glad that I did. I few months after finishing the game, and I still
think back on the playthrough fondly.

## 7. {% include game.html game="Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc" platform="" %}

Danganronpa's writing impressed me time and time again. It did so while painting
a very engrossing mystery, while pumping out great music the whole way through.
Given its nature as a mystery visual novel, it doesn't really have
replayability. But playing through it was just *so* enthralling that it easily
earned its spot on this list!

## 6. {% include game.html game="Castlevania Symphony of the Night" platform="" %}

*Honorable Mention:* Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow

Prior to 2019, I had never played a Castlevania game. I was really interested in
the Metroidvania games in the series, since I've really enjoyed the Metroid
series in the past. I finally took the plunge and played Castlevania: Symphony
of the Night this year, and I was blown away but how good it was. It was
basically a Metroid game if Metroid was a vampire legend instead of a futuristic
space adventure. I enjoyed the experience so much, that I played Castlevania:
Aria of Sorrow not long after, and really enjoyed that game too, just not as
much as I enjoyed Symphony of the Night!

## 5. {% include game.html game="Super Mario Odyssey" platform="" %}

There hadn't been a Super Mario 64 styled "collect the Stars" 3D Mario game
since Super Mario Galaxy 2. Super Mario Odyssey released a few years back to
great reception, marking the return of the 3D Mario formula, but also evolving
that formula significantly. I went in expecting a good game, but I had forgotten
just how *fun* 3D Mario games are. I loved Super Mario Odyssey, and it's so much
fun that I just might get 100% completion in it someday. I just can't help but
keep playing it and collecting more Power Moons!

## 4. {% include game.html game="The World Ends with You" platform="" %}

The World Ends with You is *such* an impressive game. It's really interesting to
see how Neku's attitude and motivations change over the course of the story. The
music is simply *phenomenal*, and the gameplay has a number of unique aspects.
That all of this runs on the original DS is even more impressive. The battle
system makes full use of both screens of the DS, and demands multitasking that
is tough to master, but never stops being fun.

## 3. {% include game.html game="Valkyria Chronicles" platform="" %}

Valkyria Chronicles was just so good! The ups and downs of this game got me more
emotional than any other game in recent memory. It does all this while fully
immersing you in a tale of war set in a fantasy world embroiled in its very own
World War II. I really enjoyed the unique painted aesthetic the graphics have as
well. The tactical battle system you use to wage war takes some getting used to,
but once you get the hang of things it becomes second nature, and is super fun!
If the sequels shape up to be similarly fun experiences, this may turn out to be
a new favorite series of mine.

## 2. {% include game.html game="Fire Emblem Three Houses" platform="" %}

*Honorable Mention:* Fire Emblem: Awakening

Fire Emblem: Three Houses had a lot to live up to in my book, since it was the
first console Fire Emblem since Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn. It absolutely
lived up to my expectations. The introduction of more social sim mechanics via
exploring the monastery definitely work for me, but aside from that, there's
more flexibility and options in battle than ever before. The strategic battle
systme has been refined yet again, and it's better than ever! I had an absolute
blast playing Three Houses this year. As far as 2019 releases go, it's
definitely my Game of the Year! Although, I did only play three games released
in 2019...

## 1. {% include game.html game="Persona 3 Portable" platform="" %}

I'll take basically any excuse to praise Persona, and since I played Persona 3
Portable for the first time earlier this year, it's fair game for this list!
There's just something magical about Persona 3 to me. Even shrunken down for the
PSP in this portable edition, it's still magical. Something about the entire
package, from the setting, themes, characters, music, and dungeon crawling
gameplay, really captivates me. While the PS2 FES version is better in some
ways, in other areas I feel Portable actually excels. Mainly, its battle system
is more enjoyable. Being able to Guard in battle and having the ability to
directly control your teammates change the battle experience in very good ways.
Plus, the top down presentation of the overworld areas is pretty charming as
well.
