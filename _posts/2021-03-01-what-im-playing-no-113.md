Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Everything is spoiler-free this week, because I only talk about one game, and I
avoided spoilers for it!

### Persona 5 Strikers *(PS4)*    {#Persona5Strikers}

Persona 5 Strikers released in Japan about a year ago as Persona 5 Scramble: The
Phantom Strikers. It took a while, but eventually a Western release was
confirmed, and it finally came out here last week. Naturally, I had it
preordered, and spent basically every waking moment playing it after my copy
arrived. It arrived on Tuesday, and I finished it on Sunday!

So what is Persona 5 Strikers (P5S)? Well, it's like a spin-off sequel to
Persona 5. I say that because while it features the characters of Persona 5 in a
brand new story that takes place several months after the first game, it
features action RPG gameplay instead of traditional turn-based gameplay. It's
from developer Omega Force, who are known for the Warriors series. Hyrule
Warriors, Fire Emblem Warriors, and (of course), Dynasty Warriors are all from
them. A lot of things from the recent Persona games *aren't* here as a result.
The time management is gone, as well as Social Links/Confidants. However, the
style Persona 5 is known for is here in full force, with all flashy menus and UI
elements you'd expect.

And though it doesn't feature several elements of P5, other staple mechanics are
very much present in Strikers, and quite deep as well. Persona fusion is
present, and though the roster of available Personas is substantially lower than
that of a normal game, there's still plenty to enjoy with this feature if you're
into it, like skill inheritance and Persona strengthening.

The main gameplay loop generally consists of cutscenes and dialogue that advance
the story, exploring and fighting your way through a dungeon, and some boss
battles. Not always in that order, you will get some short cutscenes as you
explore a dungeon, and there are a few longer periods of cutscenes between
dungeons sometimes where the main cast just hangs out together. There's also
plenty of optional side quests if you want to get distracted by those. A lot of
them are just defeating certain types of enemies or delivering quantities of
specific items, but I enjoyed doing a number of them anyway.

As an action RPG, combat is quite fast-paced, and it gets a bit hectic at times.
Sometimes you'll be fighting large numbers of weak enemies at a time, and other
times you'll be fighting fewer foes that are much stronger. You're able to
control any member of your 4 person party, switching freely between them while
exploring the dungeon or even during battle. The remainder of the Phantom
Thieves remain on standby if you don't pick them for your party, and can only be
swapped in outside of battle. Each of them has the same general controls, but
plays a bit differently, with different attack speeds and different combo
attacks. Luckily the button inputs for the combos is consistent between
characters, it's just that the combos do different things for each one. They
also have unique special skills, like being able to imbue their regular attacks
with the fire element, or transforming into a car. Just normal stuff like that.

Aside from regular attacks, you can also summon the character's Persona (or one
of Joker's many Personas if playing as him) to pause the action and choose one
of the Persona's skills to use. Like in P5, these skills cost either HP or SP to
cast, and are extremely useful, especially support skills like healing or buffs.
I'm grateful that the AI controlling the party members you're not currently
playing as is very good about healing you. One of the new characters in the
game, Sophie, has several healing skills, and the AI was very good about using
them whenever I or another member of the party was low on health, which was
*very* appreciated! Initially, I felt pretty bad at the combat. Once I got used
to the combos and abilities of a few characters, I really enjoyed the battles!

Exploring the dungeons was a lot of fun too. There are treasure chests to find,
and the exploration itself sometimes involves sneaking around or shimmying along
a ledge on a tall building. Persona 5 also had very light stealth mechanics like
this, and Strikers likewise allows you to ambush enemies from behind or from a
hiding spot for a damage bonus at the start of battle, and it's satisfying every
time.

As a fan of Persona 5, it was really cool just seeing the characters back
together for a new adventure. I would have been satisfied even if the story was
just okay, but I think the story in Strikers is pretty great actually. It's a
bit derivative of Persona 5's story in a number of ways, sure, but it was still
plenty interesting. I was always invested in what the next step was going to be
for the characters, and PatronusLight (who was watching me play) and I had a lot
of fun telling each other our theories of what we thought would happen next. As
I mentioned a bit earlier, there are also a number of scenes where the
characters are just hanging out. While these are mostly just fan-service without
real character development (at least for the returning characters), I definitely
enjoyed them. The returning characters from P5 might not see any real character
development, but the new characters, Sophia and Zenkichi, get some real
character development over the course of the game, and I ended up liking them
both a lot.

One mild complaint I have is a graphical thing: there's some pretty ugly
aliasing on the character models. You might have seen it in some of the prior
screenshots. I think the dark outlines around characters exacerbate the problem,
the game hates those and they end up looking really jagged. To be fair, there's
a graphics option that you can switch from "Framerate" (the default) to
"Graphics" that would presumably make the graphics look nicer, but I never tried
it because I wanted a smooth frame rate for battles. The aliasing looked super
ugly to me in the beginning of the game, but I guess I got used to it by the end
because it stopped bothering me.

I would absolutely recommend Persona 5 Strikers to anyone who played Persona 5,
as long as you're okay with the combat system. Combat is *very* different from
the turn-based system of Persona 5, so I can see how Strikers wouldn't be for
everyone. I really enjoyed it though. It's not nearly as long as Persona 5,
which makes it much more accessible for people without the 90+ hours of free
time Persona 5 requires. As an example, the real gameplay loop of Persona 5
probably starts around the 9 hour mark or so - prior to that, you're going
through cutscenes, tutorials, and meeting characters. In Persona 5 Strikers, I
was into the gameplay loop proper around the 3 or 4 hour mark. And that's not to
say you don't do any *playing* prior to that in either game, but that's the
point in each game where it stops holding your hand and you start to get a feel
for what the rest of the game is going to be like.

The music is a mix of tracks pulled straight from Persona 5, some brand new
songs, and remixes of songs from Persona 5, and the end result is an incredible
soundtrack! Hearing rock renditions of classic P5 songs like Last Surprise was
really cool, and always got me pumped for boss battles.

I could gush and ramble on about Persona 5 Strikers for longer, but I think I'll
wrap it up here. If the amount of time I spent playing it this week didn't make
it obvious, I really enjoyed this game. My final playtime was 46:38, and I'm a bit
sad it's over to be honest. I'm planning to get 100% trophy completion for this
game though, so I don't have to say good-bye just yet!
