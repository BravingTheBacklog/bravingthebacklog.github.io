Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Detroit: Become Human *(PS4)*    {#Detroit:BecomeHuman}

Set in Detroit in the not so distant future of 2038, Detroit: Become Human is an
adventure game that poses an answer to the question: what would our society be
like if we developed human-like, intelligent androids? Androids that look human,
speak like humans, can perform the same jobs as humans, and follow our every
order. The game explores what might happen if these androids inexplicably
become...sentient?

Released in 2018 on the PS4, and on PC in 2019 (Epic Game Store exclusive,
released on Steam in 2020), Detroit: Become Human splits its narrative between 3
main characters, all of whom are androids: Connor, Markus, and Kara, whose name
pronunciation differs depending on which character is saying it. In each chapter
of the game, you'll play as one of those 3 characters, although later chapters
with more action switch between the 3 throughout the chapter. Gameplay primarily
consists of some basic exploring, choosing dialogue options, making decisions,
and performing quick-time events. It's similar to something like Until Dawn,
Beyond: Two Souls, or a game from the Telltale Games catalog.

Where Detroit: Become Human sets itself apart is the number of branching paths
its narrative can take. The story heads a certain direction overall, but it can
end *several* different ways for each character, depending on your actions. It's
possible for the main characters to die at various points throughout the game
too, usually by failing critical quick-time events. If a character dies, they'll
be absent from the remainder of the story. Beyond that, the choices you make in
each chapter are satisfyingly *impactful*. Not every choice carries the same
weight, but a surprising number of them unlock new paths and options in future
chapters, or change your path through a future chapter altogether. This is all
shown through a flowchart for each chapter, where your choices are reflected,
and you can see where the story could have changed based on your actions, and
also how options you may have unlocked in previous chapters tie back into the
story.

Interestingly, there's actually 2 difficulty levels to choose from: Casual, and
Experienced. I started my playthrough on Experienced, but very quickly decided
this was a mistake. Experienced doesn't give you hints during the investigation
mini-games, and it also makes the quick time events more difficult. Instead of
just pushing buttons, quick time events on Experienced difficulty will have you
move your controller, or flick the right stick in a certain direction. It sounds
good on paper, but I preferred the more relaxed pace of Casual difficulty, and I
switched over to Casual after playing some of the early chapters on Experienced.

There's one more gameplay element I want to mention specifically. It's a kind of
mini-game that shows up in Connor's and Markus's chapters. Connor's chapters
usually involve investigating crime scenes. When this mini-game comes up in a
Connor chapter, you use the triggers to scrub forward and backward in time, and
you need to advance to the right times and pan the camera around to find new
evidence. It's a novel idea that helps spice up the gameplay, and I like it.

Without spoiling anything, I'd like to talk about my favorite character a bit:
Connor. Connor is kind of like a police detective android. He's sent by
CyberLife, the company that makes androids, to help investigate crimes committed
by androids who have developed free will, known as deviants. His story has a
buddy movie element to it thanks to Hank, a human, who is also a detective with
Detroit Police, and is assigned to the deviant cases as well. After playing
through the game myself, and also watching my wife play through the game, I
think Connor is both my favorite of the 3 main characters and my favorite
storyline in the game. It's fun to see how his relationship with Hank evolves
based on your actions, because there are 2 very different ends of the spectrum
their relationship can end up on. Maybe Hank will end up considering Connor a
friend, or maybe he'll end up outright hostile. The choice is up to you, and
it's really interesting how things change because of it.

Detroit: Become Human is a must-play for any fan of this kind of adventure game.
It has a lot of interesting branches in its chapters, making for good
replayability, and it's a fantastic looking game. My final time was around 10
hours, but my time for finishing the story was a little less than that since I
replayed some chapters to see other routes after finishing the game.
