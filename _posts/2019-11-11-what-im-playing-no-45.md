Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Fair warning, I spoil the final boss of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night in
this post, though I am careful to avoid plot spoilers (though there isn't a very
involved plot to begin with). If you want to totally avoid all potential
spoilers so you can play Symphony of the Night yourself in a blind run, you
shouldn't continue reading!

### Castlevania: Symphony of the Night *(PSX)*    {#Castlevania:SymphonyoftheNight}

I played through my first Castlevania game this week, Castlevania: Symphony of
the Night, and it seems like I picked a really great place to start!

Symphony of the Night is the game that put the "vania" in the metroidvania
genre. Prior to this, my understanding of Castlevania is that the games were all
stage or level based, and lacked the sprawling interconnected map and
backtracking that metroidvanias are known for. That changed with Symphony of the
Night, and you're thrust into Dracula's castle, but this time it's an enormous
map you can explore freely, with blocked paths you'll need to return to later
once you acquire the means to access them. Although, according to Wikipedia,
apparently Castlevania II: Simon's Adventure is also non-linear, so it might be
kind of metroidvania-ish?

I don't know much of the Castlevania lore, but it's easy enough to pick up
what's going on. It starts with you playing as famed vampire hunter Richter
Belmont, about to face off with Dracula. This prologue is actually a recap of
the ending of Castlevania Rondo of Blood. Richter defeats Dracula. But 4 years
later, Richter mysteriously vanishes. Dracula's castle reappears, which leads
Dracula's son, Alucard, to awaken from his slumber to destroy his father's
castle. And that's it, the premise in a nutshell. You play as Alucard, who is
introduced running through the forest towards Dracula's castle, and leaps into
the gates just as the drawbridge is closing. It's a pretty sweet opening.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GWf58IL.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GWf58ILm.png" alt="face off with Dracula"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/diHRtG0.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/diHRtG0m.png" alt="Alucard"/></a>
</figure>

As a vampire himself and the son of Dracula, Alucard should be quite powerful.
But a few minutes into the game, you run into Death, who steals away much of
Alucard's power and equipment as a punishment for not joining his father's side.
In classic metroidvania fashion, you'll spend much of the remainder of the game
exploring and gradually acquiring new abilities which lead to new paths.

<figure class="third">

What sets this apart from the Metroid series are the RPG elements in Symphony of
the Night. For one, you gain experience and level up by defeating enemies. You
also have several stats, and equipment to manage. But aside from these
differences, they feel very similar. There are some similar collectibles too,
like Life Ups that increase your maximum health, similar to how Energy Tanks in
Metroid work, and Heart Ups that increase your max number of hearts which are
used for secondary weapon attacks, which are a bit like Missile Tanks in
Metroid.

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PEpC3rv.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PEpC3rvm.png" alt="Life Ups"/></a>
</figure>

Eventually you can also find cards that let you summon a few different
familiars, which gain experience and level up as well. You can only summon one
at a time, but having a little companion that follows you around and helps you
is really nice. Additionally, there are spells you can cast that require
inputting fighting game style combos. You can also perform these at any time if
you know the required combo, you don't need to unlock them or anything first.
There is a spot to purchase the combo information in-game, which I used in the
beginning...but eventually I just looked them up online.

</figure>

There's a heavier focus on combat compared to Metroid, with more enemies and
more bosses than I remember the Metroid series having. Although it has been some
time since I played a Metroid game, so I might be forgetting how they feel. But
as Alucard, you'll cut down tons of nightmarish enemies and bosses. It's
awesome!

<figure class="half">

</figure>

Some of the boss battles are straightforward, while others are pretty intense. A
few gave me a Game Over, but that just made defeating them next time that much
sweeter. Naturally, Dracula is the final boss. Though I beat him without getting
a Game Over, I made sure I went in fully prepared, and the Soul Steal spell and
Faerie familiar played a big part in keeping me alive.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qfrrC4K.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qfrrC4Km.png" alt="Dracula"/></a>
</figure>

That's the gist of Symphony of the Night. I've left out most spoilers, except
that the final boss is Dracula but that's really to be expected with the series.
Awesome metroidvania, I really enjoyed it! There are multiple endings depending
on what % of the map you have explored when you clear the game, and I got the
"okay" ending from what I can tell. It seems there's a better one if you get
perfect completion, but I don't think I'll go back and try for it. I'm happy
with the exploration I did an the ending I got! It's definitely a game I can see
myself replaying someday though, especially since you can play through the whole
thing as Richter instead of Alucard. Once you clear the game, there are
instructions on the File Select screen that tell you to enter the file name as
"RICHTER" to play as Richter...maybe someday I will!

### Super Smash Bros. Ultimate *(Switch)*    {#SuperSmashBrosUltimate}

With the release of a new DLC fighter, Terry Bogard, I booted up Smash Bros. for
a little while this week to give him and his new stage a try!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xJjRBpR.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xJjRBpRm.jpg" alt="Terry Bogard"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/muKJdrQ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/muKJdrQm.jpg" alt="new stage"/></a>
</figure>

I didn't play much, since I was basically totally absorbed with Castlevania this
week, but Terry seems like another cool addition to the roster. He has both a
forward special and back special, the only character to feature different
special moves depending on facing. His special attacks also all have different
variants depending on if you enter a fighting game type combo with the joystick
prior to using the move. His stage also draws inspiration from fighting games.
The sides are walled off, making it impossible to kill your opponent at
extremely low percent. Instead, you first need to build up some damage on them
before launching them at the sides of the stage, and once they have enough
damage they'll break through the "wall" and get KO'd. Or you can launch them off
the top of the stage, I don't think that's walled off.
