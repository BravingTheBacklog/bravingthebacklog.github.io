I tuned into the PS5 Showcase event out of curiosity, wondering what games Sony
would feature to show off its next-gen console. It was a pretty good event, with
a lot of games shown and revealed. I'm not sure when I'll pick up a PS5, but
some of these PS5 exclusives are definitely intriguing, so I'm guessing I'll get
one eventually. For now, here are my **Top 10 Games from the PS5 Reveal**!

From watching the trailer, I wasn't sure what the gameplay hook would be. There
appeared to be action combat, but the segments of the trailer focusing on the
old man threw me for a loop. Were those part of the gameplay, or just there for
effect and to reinforce the tone of the game? Reading about Little Devil Inside
after the event, it's apparently a survival game, and had a successful
Kickstarter campaign a while back. Art direction and design seem promising but
I'm not sure what to make of the gameplay yet.

Little Devil Inside is a timed console exclusive coming to current gen consoles
as well, and coming to PC later.

## 9. {% include game.html game="Oddworld Soulstorm" video="F9b-_jCCBhg" %}

Wait, this is a true Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey sequel? That's awesome! I never
finished it, but I have a lot of nostalgia for Abe's Odyssey and Abe himself, so
seeing him in HD and seeing some snippets of the gameplay was really cool.

Oddworld: Soulstorm is a timed console exclusive, and will release on PC later.
 
## 8. {% include game.html game="Stray" video="u84hRUQlaio" %}

I had no idea what kind of game this is based on what was shown, but the world
looked pretty awesome. A [Steam store
page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/) is already up for it,
and says it's a "third-person cat adventure game." Alright, I could be on board
for that!

Stray is a timed console exclusive, and will release on PC later.

## 7. {% include game.html game="Bugsnax" video="6-v1BxSETvI" %}

This game looks hilariously weird. From the creator of Octodad, so I guess
that's to be expected! Octodad worked out really well though and was super fun,
so I'm interested in seeing how this turns out. The "Bugsnax" song in the
trailer was pretty catchy too. Gameplay details in the trailer were sparse, but
I imagine it has something to do with eating the Bugsnax creatures and
transforming your character's body parts into snacks. Or maybe there's some kind
of simulation mechanic and you'll be in charge of a village of many walrus
creatures, all eating Bugsnax and developing weenie hands? Only time will tell.

Bugsnax will be a timed PS4 and PS5 console exclusive, coming to PC at a later date.

## 6. {% include game.html game="Horizon Forbidden West" video="Lq594XmpPBg" %}

The landscapes in the trailer were *beautiful*. I got chills when Aloy rode out
on that mechanical mount, and I haven't even played the first game! Hopefully my
seeing this trailer didn't spoil anything from the first game for me. The
visuals looked amazing, but none of it looked like real gameplay. I'm really
curious to see how it looks during actual gameplay. Also, the mechanical war
elephant at the end looks awesome!

This is a PS5 exclusive, which isn't a surprise as the first game released as a
PlayStation exclusive as well, and remained that way for a several years before
coming to PC.

## 5. {% include game.html game="Spider-Man Miles Morales" video="gHzuHo80U2M" %}
 
Spider-Man on PS4 looked and played great, so if this followup game is able to
iterate on that and make even small improvements, it will be a great game. Some
time after the event, news outlets received clarification from Insomniac that
this is more of an expansion to PS4's Spider-Man than a full sequel. It is a
standalone game though, probably similar to what Dishonored: Death of the
Outsider was to Dishonored 2. I totally thought Spider-Man: Miles Morales was a
full sequel from watching the trailer, but a new Spider-Man game with a reduced
scope is fine by me too as long as the quality is on par with or greater than
the original.

Like Spider-Man on PS4, Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be a PS5 exclusive.

## 4. {% include game.html game="Kena Bridge of Spirits" video="OxzWlIbnp3U" %}
 
Looks super adorable! Visuals really are gorgeous. This will be coming to PC
eventually, but I really doubt it would look this good on my current PC.
Watching the trailer, I imagined this was probably an action-adventure or 3D
platformer, or some mix between the two. Reading the Epic Games Store page
that's already up for the game, it's described as a "story driven, action
adventure combining exploration with fast-paced combat," and that definitely
sounds like something I'd be interested in!

Kena: Bridge of Spirits will be a timed console exclusive, and release later on
PC.

## 3. {% include game.html game="Hitman III" video="NsJyTTsp-PE" %}
 
I've only played Hitman: Absolution, but the cinematic trailer was really
impressive! I loved the music and vibe. I have no idea if I'd love the game, but
the trailer really made a good impression.

There was no mentioned of timed console exclusivity in the trailer, but from
what I read on Wikipedia and some assorted gaming news outlets is that this will
be cross-platform at launch, on both current and next gen systems, and PC.

## 2. {% include game.html game="Deathloop" video="mc2hz3LJhTY" %}
 
I adore Arkane's Dishonored series, so I'm pretty interested in Deathloop!
Certain aspects of the trailer reminded me of Dishonored in terms of level
design and gameplay, and the aesthetic seems promising. I thought to myself
"wow, this is basically Dishonored with guns" before I realized that there are
guns in Dishonored, so...I guess it's just like Dishonored with some new twists,
and *more* guns! No release date given on this one, so I'm not sure how long the
wait will be.

Deathloop will be a timed PS5 exclusive, coming to PC later.

## 1. {% include game.html game="GhostWire Tokyo" video="l4tkNjJsOvY" %}
 
I am so on board with this game. Fighting supernatural creatures in Tokyo using
your own supernatural powers? Awesome! The creatures you fight seem to be
inspired by or directly pulled from Japanese folklore. It's first-person, and
that combined with the eerie foes could make this a very creepy game to play.
GhostWire is an action adventure game though, not a horror game, so chances are
it'll have a few scares, but it'll mostly be about fighting spirits and other
baddies in Tokyo, and I am ready for that!

GhostWire: Tokyo is a timed PS5 exclusive, coming to PC at a later date. I'm not
sure when I'll get a PS5, so it's good to know it's coming to PC at some point
too. Although if my PC can't run it, I might have no choice but to pick up a
PS5, because this game looks awesome!
