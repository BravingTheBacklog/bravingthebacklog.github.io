Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

### Touhou Luna Nights *(PC)*    {#TouhouLunaNights}

So, this is a game I picked up pretty much out of nowhere. I think I probably
heard about it on the Metroidvania subreddit at least once, but that's about it.
It's on Steam, but I played it through PC Game Pass - I'll talk about that more
in a future post, but for now, let me tell you about Touhou Luna Nights.

There's a Japanese side-scrolling shoot 'em up/bullet hell series called Touhou
Project, developed by the one-man developer Team Shanghai Alice since 1997. It
spans 18 main titles and several spin-offs, including spin-offs in other genres.
This game, Touhou Luna Nights, is a Touhou Project fangame, developed by Team
Ladybug. Presumably, they're fans of the series, and enjoyed it and its
characters so much that they decided to create their own game featuring some of
its mechanics and characters. The creator of the original Touhou Project series,
ZUN, is *very* permissive of this sort of thing, so there are numerous fan works
like this. I didn't know any of this until after I finished the game and looked
it up, but you don't really *need* to know any of it to enjoy the game.

You play as Sakuya, a maid with the power to stop time. She falls solidly into
the "super-capable ninja maid" anime trope, and you'll spend most of the game
running through around, throwing knives at enemies. Lots, and lots of knives.

The highlight of the game is definitely the time stopping mechanic. You can only
stop time for a while before it forcibly resumes, and the timer ticks down
faster whenever you move. Since time is stopped, when you attack while using
your power, you'll leave knives suspended in mid-air. You can lay down *several*
groups of knives around an enemy with time stopped, move to somewhere safe, and
then resume time and watch all the knives obliterate them. It's really cool,
this is something that I haven't seen in another metroidvanias, and it's a
really fun gimmick!

Your time stopping powers also extend to the platforming as it becomes more
involved, especially in one of the later areas of the game, the Clock Tower.
Here, all the time stopping challenges that have been introduced so far come
together. Objects that continue moving even when you've stopped time, things
that only move when time is stopped, and things that move in reverse when time
is stopped. These effects are applied to both hazardous objects and platforms,
and the combinations force you to stop and resume time frequently in order to
make it through.

This is a good time to mention that Luna Nights is mostly based on the
characters and setting of the Touhou Project game "The Embodiment of Scarlet
Devil," released in 2002. I'm not sure if that game has as much of it, but Luna
Nights has a *ton* of Castlevania influence. The Clock Tower area I just
mentioned is obviously inspired by the Clock Towers often found in Castlevania
games, and it's even filled with turning gears, plenty of spikes, and other
hazards. There's no Medusa Head enemies flying around though, which is fine by
me!

The time manipulation mechanic is also worked into the boss fights very nicely.
There are several bosses in the game, and many of them have attacks that would
be hard to dodge without stopping time. Even being able to stop time, the boss
fights are pretty tough at first. I got several Game Overs trying to defeat
them, and I was only able to get past them after learning their attacks a little
better and figuring out which of my own special attacks would deal the most
damage.

Luna Nights was a very short game, my final time was only 3:37 according to the
Xbox app. It's a very focused experience, and makes the most of its unique
gameplay mechanics in its short runtime. There's some minimal required
backtracking, I mean, this is a metroidvania after all, with additional optional
backtracking if you want to get some extra upgrades, but it never wastes your
time. I'd definitely recommend it to fans of the genre, it's just so much fun
the whole way through!
