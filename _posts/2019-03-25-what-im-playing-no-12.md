Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Games contained within this post:

 - Pokémon Ultra Moon *(3DS)*

### Pokémon Ultra Moon *(3DS)*

So when I said last week that I was going to call my post-game adventures
"Complete" in Ultra Moon...well, that was just a Fake Out, I guess! I'm still
playing this a bit! Just wandering around Alola exploring, I seem to be finding
all kinds of little post-game activities.

I revisited Iki Village and talked to Hala, and we battled once more! I wiped
the floor with him. My reward for this victory: Z Crystals for the starter
Pokémon I didn't pick.

</figure>

Oh, also, remember those 55 Big Nuggets that are the reward for completing
Episode Rainbow Rocket? Well, 55 Big Nuggets sell for a lot! I have more money
now that I know what to do with. That's the kind of thing that feels like a
fitting post-game reward: more money than I'd ever seen before in-game.

In continuing my Tapu hunt, I went to visit the shrine on the first island.
Before I made it to the shrine, I ran into Lillie and Nebby. Deciding to entrust
Nebby (now Lunala) to me, Lillie requested I battle Lunala and capture it in a
Poké Ball. Thus, the battle with Lunala began!

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ycg8NCY.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ycg8NCYm.png" alt="the battle with Lunala began"/></a>
</figure>

I paralyzed it quickly with my Manetric, then switched in my Aegislash who knows
False Swipe, wanting to bring its HP down to 1. Well, that plan was quickly
foiled when I realized Lunala is Psychic-Ghost type and False Swipe has no
effect. I didn't want to risk killing it, so I didn't attack it too much and
just threw Ultra Balls at it at near full health. A few Ultra Balls later, it
was mine! Not a very difficult catch after all.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

With Lunala captured and sent to a PC box, I could continue on to face the
Pokémon I was there for: Tapu Koko. Tapu Koko was a little tricky because I
couldn't paralyze it, I guess because it has an Electric type. I could still
weaken it with False Swipe though, and I captured it in an Ultra Ball after
several broke.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/e8Gi3NA.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/e8Gi3NAm.png" alt="Tapu Koko"/></a>

</figure>

Then it was on to the final Tapu, Tapu Bulu. I used the usual tactic, paralyzed
it and brought it down to 1 HP. Despite all this, it still broke through a
surprising number of Ultra Balls before finally staying. It probably took around
8 Ultra Balls, I think. Nevertheless, in the end it was mine, which meant I had
completed my Land Guardian Poké Dex page!

### The Sims 4 *(PC)*

More Sims! I've been playing a little bit here and there in the past few weeks,
The Sims is just a nice game to come back to again and again as I keep building
upon the story and legacy of my Sims.

[![family tree is progressing nicely](https://i.imgur.com/08ZjbdMm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/08ZjbdM.png)

First off, we can see as a result of Demario's deeds last week that his family
tree is progressing nicely. He has so many descendants now that they don't fit
in the genealogy window all at once, so I had to bust out my advanced Photoshop
skills to work some magic. I didn't play as Demario this week though, I've
returned to his vampiric granddaughter, Kayleigh.

Kayleigh spent some time looking for a new potential suitor to father another
child. The first man didn't work out, as he left her house before she had a
chance to Try for Baby.

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LcveKUw.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LcveKUwm.png" alt="This man"/></a>
</figure>

Never fear though, she found a new suitor shortly after, and after putting the
moves on him at a local bar and Trying for Baby in the closet, Kayleigh became
pregnant with her second son.

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PLlDL5z.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PLlDL5zm.png" alt="putting the moves on him"/></a>
</figure>

Once he was born I aged him up from a baby to a toddler immediately because I
think the baby life stage in The Sims 4 is pointless. Kayleigh had no desire for
motherhood as she stood holding him blank-faced, so I again moved the new child
to live with his father. Kayleigh's lineage is now well on its way! I don't
intend to give her any more children, but you never know. I am super glad
Demario still shows up on in her genealogy window, even though her parents were
erased from memory by my earlier MCCC blunder.

### Jeanne d'Arc *(PSP)*

I've started playing this fine strategy RPG this week! Think Fire Emblem or
Final Fantasy Tactics, but set during the Hundred Years' War in an alternate
reality with monsters and magic. It's pretty awesome, and a whole lot of fun! It
was developed by noted Japanese developer Level-5, who have put out a number of
well received series including Professor Layton and Yo-Kai Watch. This will be
the first Level-5 game I play, as far as I can remember. One thing to note about
the screenshots this week, you'll see varying resolutions and quality, since I
switched from emulating on my phone, PSTV, and PC when capturing them. I've
settled into emulating on the PC with a higher rendering resolution, and I
think it looks quite nice!

<figure class="half">

</figure>

In the world of Jeanne d'Arc, there was an ancient war between humans and demons
in ages past. Humanity was able to defeat the demons and seal them away with the
help of five Holy Armlets. Many years later, during the Hundred Years' War, the
English have allied themselves with demons, partnering with them to occupy
France. It also seems the young king Henry VI is possessed by demons as well.

From the very beginning, I was impressed with the quality of the animated
cutscenes. Considering the small resolution of the PSP the have to use, they
look absolutely wonderful from what I've seen so far. They aid in telling the
story of Jeanne, who finds a legendary Holy Armlet in the forest. The Holy
Armlet attaches to her wrist, and gives her the strength to fight, allowing her
to transform into a sort of Holy Warrior form. That same night, her village is
attacked and destroyed by the English and their demon allies, and Jeanne begins
her journey driven by anger, and begins hearing a voice in her head telling her
to fight and save France.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

My knowledge of the Hundred Years' War is basically non-existent, but I've read
many of the figures Jeanne meets are based on real people from history, such as
Charles VII. The characters I've met so far have a lot of character. Colet has a
very unique way of speaking, basically a stereotypical French accent but
combined with Elmer Fudd's difficulty with the letter "R." He's just one of the
colorful and fun cast. There's also the lion-man La Hire, who I guess is just a
normal occurrence in this world because no one seems to react unusually to his
appearance.

[![tutorials are presented in slides like this](https://i.imgur.com/3VgB2FNm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/3VgB2FN.png)
{: .image-right }

The in-game tutorials are also excellent, and look just as polished and
excellent as the rest of the game. The tutorials are presented in slides. The
one depicted here explains Burning Auras, a unique feature compared to the other
strategy RPGs I've played. After you attack an enemy, the space opposite the
side you attacked will be surrounded with a Burning Aura (unless it's an
impassible tile I think), and if you are able to position a unit in that tile
and launch an attack, they will deal more damage. This can tip the scales in
your favor *hugely*, if utilized frequently!

There are various weapon types as well, some of which have different attack
ranges, like how lances reach two tiles. Likewise bows can reach several tiles
including adjacent ones, but unlike other types of weapon users a bow-wielder
cannot counter.

[![get all allies to the exit](https://i.imgur.com/VnAcILum.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/VnAcILu.jpg)
{: .image-right }

I also really like how the victory conditions of each mission have a bit of
variety. So far I've encountered the usual "defeat all enemies to win"
condition, or sometimes a "defeat boss" condition, but one mission's victory
condition was to get all allies to the exit. Failure conditions also vary
between missions, which I think helps keep things interesting. Usually it's "you
fail if all your allies fall," but sometimes you lose if Jeanne falls, or if
*anyone* falls. I actually got a Game Over due to that last one, I was just a
little too reckless with my units.

Another feature that plays into strategy hugely is Jeanne's ability to
Transform. Because she has the Holy Armlet, she can transform in battle into a
super powered form. It takes a few turns initially to charge before
transformation is available, but once transformed Jeanne deals more damage,
gains access to a unique and powerful skill, and most importantly gets to take
another turn every time she defeats an enemy. You can Transform once per *Gem*
per battle, and so far I've collected two Gems for Jeanne's Holy Armlet, so she
can actually use Transform twice now!

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zfUxmta.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zfUxmtam.jpg" alt="You can Transform once per *Gem*"/></a>
</figure>

There's also a World Map system. Similarly to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance or
some Fire Emblem titles, the World Map allows you to traverse your known
locations on the map freely, stopping at previously unlocked locations to buy
equipment, skills, or items where available. When you're ready to advance the
story, you simply head to the location of your objective. There's a Free Battle
system as well, where you can return to prior locations on the World Map to
fight battles and gain extra experience or items.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XXlLpnt.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XXlLpntm.png" alt="buy equipment, skills, or items where available"/></a>
</figure>

The ability to equip different skills for your characters is nice too. Each
character can have up to 3 equipped initially, though they gain more slots as
they level up. Each skill has a prerequisite level required to equip it. You're
pretty free to customize your units with skills as you see fit. One use of the
aforementioned skills is in giving a character a Spirit Affinity. The Spirit
Affinities system seems sort of similar to Fire Emblem's Weapons Triangle.
Basically, there's 3 affinities and each receives a bonus against 1 other
affinity and a penalty against the other one. Skills are equipped to increase
Spirit Affinities. It seems like a nice system that could make a difference in
tense combat situations. Finally, as if all that weren't enough, you also gain
the ability to fuse certain skills together to form new ones relatively early on
in the game, a feature they call Binding Skill Stones!

</figure>

In summary, I'm *loving* Jeanne d'Arc so far. The story, characters, and
gameplay are all absolutely wonderful, and I can't wait to play more! I expected
it to be good, but I didn't know it would be *this* good!
