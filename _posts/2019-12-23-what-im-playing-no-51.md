Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

I've kept my writings on Tokyo Dark spoiler-free. The section on Super Mario
Odyssey continues to talk about the post-game, so there are post-game content
spoilers within. Finally, there are main story Cadence of Hyrule spoilers, and
spoilers for Octavo's story, so watch out for those! Although, the story in
Cadence of Hyrule is pretty minimal.

### Super Mario Odyssey *(Switch)*    {#SuperMarioOdyssey}

I delved into the post-game content a bit this week, collecting Power Moons that
were newly available in the post-game, as well as some of the *multitude* of
Moons I missed the first time around in each world!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DVQmIft.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DVQmIftm.jpg" alt="newly available"/></a>

</figure>

One source of post-game exclusive Power Moons is finding Princess Peach in each
world. Back in her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom, the Toads say Peach packed up
and left. Well, turns out she decided to go sight-seeing around the world, back
to the places Bowser had dragged her through while she was kidnapped, to
experience these locales on her own terms! She also gives you a Power Moon when
you find her in each world. It's pretty cool seeing Peach traveling on her own,
and wearing an outfit specific to each world!

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zP1vDn8.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zP1vDn8m.jpg" alt="gives you a Power Moon"/></a>
</figure>

Also exclusive to the post-game are the newly awakened Moon Rocks in each world.
Finding the Moon Rock in a world and giving it a ground pound or throwing Cappy
at it activates it, releasing a bunch of new Power Moons in that world and
showing their locations on your map! This makes fetching these new Power Moons
much easier, though it should be noted that only the Power Moons released by the
Moon Rock are added to your map. The original Power Moons in the world still
need to be hunted down manually via careful exploration!

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mQqiIee.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mQqiIeem.jpg" alt="Moon Rocks"/></a>

</figure>

There's a cool new type of challenge that I believe is part of the group of
Power Moons released by activating a Moon Rock: Trace-Walking! The rules are
simple, you just need to walk around and trace the given shape on the ground.
However, the guide arrows disappear within a second or two after you start
walking, and you'll have to rely on your memory to trace the rest of the shape!
I feel like I did pretty poorly on my first one, where the white dots are the
path I walked and the blue arrows show the shape I was supposed to walk.
However, I still did well enough to earn the Power Moon for that Trace-Walking
challenge! Maybe the game is just extra forgiving on your first Trace-Walking
challenge!

<figure class="half">

</figure>

I got enough Power Moons to reach a new, post-game area: The Dark Side of the
Moon. Naturally, I went there right away! Since it's on the moon, it has reduced
gravity like the Moon Kingdom, making your jumps super floaty! There are a lot
of rabbits living there, so it seems likely that this is the Broodals home. So
far the only thing I've seen present here is a Broodal Boss Rush mode, where you
have to fight the Broodals one after the other, with seemingly no health pickups
during or between the fights. I gave it a try, and beat the first boss with 1 HP
remaining, only to instantly die during the second boss fight. I don't really
see myself revisiting the Dark Side of the Moon any time soon if all that's
there is the boss rush mode.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mwV8ep1.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mwV8ep1m.jpg" alt="Broodal Boss Rush"/></a>
</figure>

I didn't stop there though! I kept collecting Power Moons, until finally I
reached the 500 Power Moon mark and the Odyssey powered up for what seems like
the final time. This allowed me to reach what I think is the final area of the
post-game: The Darker Side of the Moon. There's a pretty sweet party going on
here, and when you walk around the partygoers cheer you on and tell you can
overcome what's waiting for you ahead. So...what's waiting for you on the Darker
Side of the Moon?

<figure class="third">

</figure>

Well, from what I've seen so far it's a long and challenging obstacle course,
demanding a level of skill in Mario's jumping and enemy capturing abilities not
seen anywhere else in the game. It's been a real challenge so far, since there
are no checkpoints in the middle. There are a few health pickups in the middle,
but you really can't mess up too many times while challenging the course. I
haven't reached the end yet, but I'm really curious to do so! I can only imagine
that Bowser, who was left on the Moon at the end of the main story, has built
this sadistic course for Mario, and is waiting to battle him at the end. I
*will* finish the Darker Side of the Moon eventually, I swear!

### Tokyo Dark *(PC)*    {#TokyoDark}

Following up Danganronpa, I played through the Point-and-Click/Visual Novel
hybrid, Tokyo Dark this week!

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bcXhnga.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bcXhngam.jpg" alt="Tokyo Dark"/>
        <figcaption>Tokyo Dark</figcaption>
    </a>
</figure>

Tokyo Dark puts you in the shoes of Detective Itō, a member of the Tokyo
Metropolitan Police. Her partner vanished 5 days ago without a trace, but now
his phone has mysteriously turned back on, allowing the police to get a GPS
trace on it. Itō is sent to investigate first, with backup on the way. It's
there that the story begins, and you're given a chance to get a feel for the
gameplay. Primarily, you'll perform investigations, talking to people and
solving puzzles to try and figure on what's going on, and to learn more about
what Itō's partner was looking into before his disappearance.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zFx2R1p.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zFx2R1pm.jpg" alt="Detective Itō"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CTlJ7CR.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CTlJ7CRm.jpg" alt="Her partner vanished 5 days"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/57bRTeo.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/57bRTeom.jpg" alt="perform investigations"/></a>
</figure>

At the heart of all this is the SPIN system. The game is a little heavy-handed
in explaining this, which sort of took me out of the experience a bit during
those conversations. Depending on your actions, Itō's Sanity, Professionalism,
Investigation, and Neurosis (SPIN) will increase or decrease. Drinking on the
job? Not very professional, but it may help you get closer to other characters,
increasing your Investigation.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wEwX0JP.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wEwX0JPm.jpg" alt="heavy-handed"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wZMQ6We.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wZMQ6Wem.jpg" alt="increase or decrease"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/52l4FhV.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/52l4FhVm.jpg" alt="Drinking on the job"/></a>
</figure>

[![Sanity](https://i.imgur.com/TeyUw0pm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/TeyUw0p.jpg)
{: .image-right }

Unfortunately, the SPIN system never really amounted to much. Sanity is the
probably the most important factor, but its influence on the experience as a
whole seems negligible. I didn't see it, but I know there's a unique ending you
can get by having really low Sanity at a certain point in the game. But other
than that...I don't know that it or any of the other SPIN stats have much of an
effect? There seem to be two sets of endings available to you depending on your
SPIN stats, but I'm not sure what the stat threshold between the endings is.

I went in expecting SPIN to play a much larger role than it did, and while it
was a little disappointing, the story in Tokyo Dark did not disappoint! I was
hooked until the end. The first ending I saw was pretty grim. It felt wholly
wrong, and I feel like it's probably the worst ending to be honest, even though
the choices seemed right at the time. I knew the game had many different
endings, and I had to see a few more of them. Finishing the game the first time
unlocks New Game+ mode, which has some alternate dialogue with certain
characters. New Game+ also has an exclusive ending, which seems to be the canon
one. More importantly, finishing the game once unlocks "Broken Memories," which
allows you to have multiple saves instead of being limited to the 1 available to
you during the first playthrough.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oU0rAzf.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oU0rAzfm.jpg" alt="unlocks"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PX5JWyj.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PX5JWyjm.jpg" alt="alternate dialogue"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/i1dzDpA.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i1dzDpAm.jpg" alt="Broken Memories"/></a>
</figure>

Having multiple saves made it a lot easier to see more endings, because I could
load an earlier save to see what ending a different choice lead to. I still had
to replay the game from the beginning to get to that point, which I did in New
Game+. On repeat playthroughs, some conversations can be skipped by clicking a
newly visible skip button. For some reason, other conversations can't be skipped
though, even if there aren't any choices to be made in them. When replaying
those sections, I just clicked through the dialogue as fast as I could since I'd
heard the conversations before.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hKnYZGw.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hKnYZGwm.jpg" alt="replay"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WRiM4MF.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WRiM4MFm.jpg" alt="those sections"/></a>
</figure>

It would have been nice if SPIN had a greater affect on more of the game. It
would have been nice to be able to start from whatever chapter I wanted after
finishing the game instead of needing to replay from the beginning. Despite
these complaints, I did enjoy the game, it's a good experience. Fair warning
though, it's not a happy game. There are fleeting happy moments, but overall the
story is tragic, with some especially heartbreaking endings. Having to replay it
from the beginning wasn't *really* that inconvenient since it's pretty short. My
first playthrough was only about 4 hours. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for
a point and click adventure with a horror/mystery flair!

### Cadence of Hyrule - Crypt of the NecroDancer Featuring The Legend of Zelda *(Switch)*    {#CadenceofHyrule-CryptoftheNecroDancerFeaturingTheLegendofZelda}

I played through another run of Cadence of Hyrule to try out the latest update,
because it adds a new story mode option with a new playable character: Octavo,
the villain from the main story!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZBeqTqo.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZBeqTqom.jpg" alt="Octavo"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MuE0mEl.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MuE0mElm.jpg" alt="villain"/></a>
</figure>

I don't really remember the details of his role in the original story, only that
he was the bad guy. Octavo's story starts with him getting his fortune told, and
literally taking his fate into his own hands by stealing the Threads of Fate
from the old fortune teller woman. Setting out to change his fate, he begins
searching for a champion strong enough to defeat Ganon for him, because he knows
Ganon's return is inevitable.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/aUTWlRU.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aUTWlRUm.jpg" alt="taking his fate into his own hands"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zuGTO7T.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zuGTO7Tm.jpg" alt="searching for a champion"/></a>
</figure>

His search for a champion to face Ganon takes him to the same temples you'd
visit in the original story, and he fights the same bosses. However, he's still
the one bringing the bosses to life from the magical instruments, and the battle
with them is a test of their strength to see if they're a suitable champion.
Naturally, they're each defeated by Octavo, and in the end he sets off to face
Ganon himself.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/a9UvlJl.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/a9UvlJlm.jpg" alt="he fights the same bosses"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/uo25kkI.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uo25kkIm.jpg" alt="Octavo"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2NbXVFf.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2NbXVFfm.jpg" alt="he sets off to face Ganon himself"/></a>
</figure>

Octavo enters a portal to the future to defeat Ganon there. However, he finds
something unexpected. Instead of Ganon ruling Hyrule in the future, he finds a
future version of himself, but he's been corrupted by power and turned into the
NecroDancer! Wanting to set things right, Octavo defeats his future self, and
uses the combined power of his Golden Lute and his future self's Golden Lute to
make it so he never stole the Threads of Fate.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/icQnMO3.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/icQnMO3m.jpg" alt="the NecroDancer"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FnFjjd3.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FnFjjd3m.jpg" alt="his future self"/></a>
</figure>

Playing as Octavo was a fun time! Unlike the other characters, Octavo doesn't
need to keep finding new weapons to use. He starts the game with the unbreakable
Golden Lute, and will keep it throughout the run. It is a pretty good weapon
though, damaging 3 tiles around Octavo as he moves. Other than that, the
equipment you find seems to be the same as the other characters. Bombs, Bow and
Arrow, the usual Zelda gear.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qm7E4q1.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qm7E4q1m.jpg" alt="a fun time"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/49QEiBp.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/49QEiBpm.jpg" alt="Golden Lute"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/If0uupm.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/If0uupmm.jpg" alt="Zelda gear"/></a>
</figure>

Just like Link and Zelda, Octavo also has abilities to find that are unique to
him. The Haste and Fireball spells. I honestly forgot to use these most of the
time, but they're pretty cool. Haste lets you move without regard to the beat
for several moves, which sounds really powerful and I probably should have used
it a lot more. The downside of Haste is that it takes a full magic meter to
cast, so its strength is balanced out.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/iI3bFgc.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iI3bFgcm.jpg" alt="Haste"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/botBO5w.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/botBO5wm.jpg" alt="Fireball"/></a>
</figure>

One neat detail when playing as Octavo is that a few NPCs you find in the world
remember the evil things he did prior to the start of story mode. For instance,
a woman in Kakariko Village mentions seeing a strange man with a lute near the
crypt. She then realizes that Octavo is that strange man and calls you out on
it!

<figure class="half">

</figure>

[![Achievement](https://i.imgur.com/8GWgfGzm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/8GWgfGz.jpg)
{: .image-right }

A new feature I noticed that wasn't in the game when I initially played is the
in-game Achievement system. Since the Switch doesn't have global achievement
support, developers need to implement achievements themselves if they want them
in their games on Switch. I'm not sure which patch added them, but Cadence of
Hyrule now has its own set of achievements, which is pretty cool!
