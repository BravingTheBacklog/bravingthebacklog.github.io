There are a lot of video game genres out there. Puzzle games, action games, life
simulation games, racing games...the list goes on. I enjoy many types of games,
but I especially love RPGs. Yet despite my self-professed love of the genre,
there are so many beloved RPG series that I've never played before! In
fact...there's easily enough to make a Top 10 list...!

<!--more-->

The ranking is here is loosely based on a combination of how influential I feel
the series is and how excited I am to try it. Just a quick disclaimer, there
will be some ARPGs and SRPGs in here too, not just classic turn-based RPGs.
Since I haven't played any games from these series yet, screenshots have been
sourced from store pages and GameFAQs. With that said, let's get started!

## 10. Atelier

Despite ranking it lowest on this list, I'm actually really curious about the
Atelier series. I don't know if it will be the kind of thing I enjoy or not, but
I want to find out! I'm not sure where I'm going to start with it, or when.
There are a ton of games in the series, including a few trilogies. Several of
the more recent titles are on Steam now, so chances are one of those will be my
entry point into the Atelier series someday.

## 9. Yo-kai Watch

I have to find out what this series is all about! It was once touted as the
"Pokémon Killer" franchise by some, and while Pokémon still seems to be selling
as well as ever, Yokai Watch has grown into reasonably a successful franchise as
well, releasing 4 "generations" of games beginning with the 2013 Japanese
release of the first game. Plus, there's Yo-kai Watch merchandise, manga, and
anime. It sounds like gameplay differs substantially from Pokémon, with the main
similarity being that you collect some kind of monster in both series. Yo-kai
Watch 2 will probably be where I start with this series.

## 8. Ys

The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel games I've played have given me a lot
of respect for Falcom as a developer, and for Falcom Sound Team for their
ability to craft great music. Ys is another Falcom-developed series, but these
are ARPGs instead of turn-based RPGs. Ys has been around since 1987, but the
games I'm mainly interested in are the games for PSP and onward. These are the
ones with music from Falcom Sound Team, and many of them have PC releases on
Steam as well.

## 7. Star Ocean

As a big fan of the Tales games, the Star Ocean series should be an obvious
choice for me. Despite this, I've never played a game in the series! Well,
technically I started Star Ocean: The Last Hope once and embarrassingly got
stuck in the first area after finishing the combat tutorial. I'm still not
really sure how that happened. I don't think that counts as playing the series,
since all I experienced was the basics of combat and didn't get far enough to
appreciate the characters or story. Anyway, since I already own a copy of Star
Ocean: The Last Hope on PS3, that's where I plan to start!

## 6. Shining

The games in this series switch genres, but are united by a common game world
and titles that begin with the word "Shining." I think of the SRPG Shining Force
games when I think of the series, but there is also the first-person dungeon
crawler Shining in the Darkness and the ARPG Shining Soul duology. My plan is to
start with Shining Force II!

## 5. Xeno

Whether it's Xenogears, the Xenosaga trilogy, or Xenoblade Chronicles games,
I've never played any of the "Xeno" series. It definitely has an interesting
history given that the rights holder for each sub-series is different. Xenogears
is owned by Square Enix, Xenosaga is owned by Bandai Namco, and Xenoblade is
owned by Nintendo. Since each of the sub-series are isolated in terms of
setting, I'm not sure where I'll start with these. I already have a copy of
Xenoblade Chronicles 2 sitting on my shelf, so that might end up being where I
start.

## 4. Wild Arms

Wild Arms is basically a "Wild West JRPG" series and was quite prolific in the
PS1 and PS2 era, releasing 5 mainline games across the PS1 and PS2. I wrote more
about the first game in my [Top 10 PS1 Games in my Backlog]({% post_url
2019-05-25-top-10-ps1-games-in-my-backlog %}) post, so I won't say too much more
about it here. I'm planning to start with the first game in the series, and
based on my experience with it I might tackle more games in the series at some
point in the distant future.

## 3. Suikoden

The Suikoden series spans 5 games between PS1 and PS2, with a few spin-off games
besides. Many of the games in the Suikoden series get a lot of respect and
recommendations online, especially the first two games. Once you get to the
third game and onward, opinions seem less unanimously positive, but I don't
think I've ever seen any disdain for Suikoden 1 and 2. Well, besides people
becoming irritated at [how expensive physical copies of Suikoden II can
be](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/playstation/suikoden-ii). Based on the
positive buzz surrounding the beginning of the series, I'm planning on starting
this series at the beginning, and if I'm really hooked I'll continue on with it
from there!

## 2. Shin Megami Tensei

I've never played a mainline Shin Megami Tensei game, despite my love of its
Persona spin-off series! I've played a few of the Persona games and they're some
of my favorite games of all time, so I think it's only logical that I try the
series that it spawned from at some point. Of course, the themes and stories of
Persona and Shin Megami Tensei are quite different, but that's fine with me. I
think the battle system in Persona was largely inspired by the battle system
from Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne and onward, so that seems like a good place for
me to start.

## 1. Dragon Quest

One of the grandfathers of the JRPG genre: Dragon Quest. Yes, I've never played
a mainline Dragon Quest game! I've played one of the Dragon Quest Monsters
spin-off and a bit of Dragon Quest Builders, but that's it! I also watched a
speedrun of the first game, but I'm pretty sure that's not indicative of what
the game or series is normally like due to all the weird speedrun strategies. I
still can't believe I haven't tried a series as influential as Dragon Quest, and
I plan to rectify that...eventually! I really don't know which game I'll start
with here. It'll probably be either Dragon Quest VIII or Dragon Quest XI, unless
I go the complete opposite route and start with one of the updated ports of the
original Dragon Quest.
