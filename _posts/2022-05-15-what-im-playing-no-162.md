Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Katamari Damacy Reroll *(PC)*    {#KatamariDamacyReroll}

The King of All Cosmos has gone a little overboard. He destroyed all the stars,
and the moon. It was the alcohol's fault, really. Anyway, His Excellency can't
be bothered to replace them all, so as The Prince, it's your job to scrounge up
things to rebuild the stars and moon with. It's a big job, you'd better get
started.

Katamari Damacy originally released for PlayStation 2 in 2004. An enhanced
remake called Katamari Damacy Reroll released for PC and Switch in 2018, and for
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2020. I played Reroll on PC, after getting a copy
of it on Steam from the Humble Bandai Namco Bundle 4 back in 2020.

Like I mentioned in the intro, you play as The Prince, the 5cm tall child of The
King of All Cosmos. In each of the game's levels, you have to roll around a
katamari, a magical ball that causes anything smaller than it to stick to it,
making the ball you roll around bigger and bigger. That's where the puzzle
element comes in, because you have to roll around the levels finding things
small enough for you to roll up, causing the katamari to grow and let you roll
up larger things.

You have a time limit for each level (well, there's one level that isn't timed
but that's not relevant here), and your goal in most levels is to get the
katamari to at least a certain size within the time limit. Once it reaches that
size, you can keep rolling around until the time is up though. It's fun to see
how big you can get the katamari in each level, and I replayed a few levels to
see if I could beat my previous high score.

The levels all take place in the same world, but there are always different
objects around to roll up, which make the levels feel different even if you're
rolling around the same location each time. The starting size of the katamari
also varies, sometimes you'll start out with a katamari barely bigger than a
thumbtack and you'll be rolling around a house, whereas some levels start you
out with a much larger one and you'll be rolling around city streets. There's a
lot of detail in the levels too, I didn't even realize they all took place in
the same town until closer to the end of the game, when I began to recognize
certain landmarks.

When I played Donut County a little while back, I'd heard that it had similar
gameplay to the Katamari series. I definitely see the resemblance. Both have a
similarly joyful gameplay loop. Rolling things up into the katamari is just pure
fun. Even when you get the point where you're rolling up people into the
katamari, which is sort of a horrifying concept, the game maintains this happy,
upbeat vibe. It helps that the graphics aren't realistic, and are instead
heavily stylized. The cheerful music also contributes heavily towards the happy,
energetic feeling, and it *will* get stuck in your head, by the way. It's so
catchy, I found myself whistling some of the melodies when I wasn't playing for
days after finishing the game.

Katamari Damacy is a bizarre game. The premise is weird, both the story and the
gameplay. But it's *so* much fun, and it works *so* well. It was the first game
in the series, and I'm definitely going to have to try more games in the series
at some point. This game is the only one on modern platforms at the moment, but
maybe other games in the series will see a remaster someday. My final time for
this one was 4 hours 23 minutes, and I enjoyed every minute.
