I own a PSTV, so my Vita experience is lacking what is a selling point for many
Vita games - portability. However, the Vita still has an excellent library, and
there are some enticing exclusives. The game I bought a PSTV for was Persona 4
Golden, the first Vita game I played. Playing that on a big screen was
*excellent*.

Since I only own a PSTV and can't play Vita games portably, for games that are
playable on other systems, like PC, PS3, or PS4, there's little benefit for me
to pick up the Vita version since it likely won't look or run as well as on the
other platforms. Playing on a PSTV also means I can't play games that rely
(heavily) on the Vita's touchscreen features. Despite this, there are still a
few of games I'm interested in that can be played only on the PS Vita/TV, and
here's the complete list!

## 6. {% include game.html game="Dungeon Travelers 2" %}

Originally released only in Japan for the PSP, Dungeon Travelers 2 also saw an
enhanced version released on the Vita and that version got an international
release.

I haven't been very into dungeon crawlers in the past, and that's exactly what
Dungeon Travelers 2 is. However, I've somehow convinced myself that maybe I'll
really enjoy a dungeon crawler someday if I find the right one and I'm in the
right mindset. Maybe Dungeon Travelers 2 is that game for me, who knows?

## 5 {% include game.html game="Soul Sacrifice Delta" %}

An action RPG, this is an enhanced re-release of the original Soul Sacrifice
which was also exclusively on PS Vita. The interesting hook here is that
whenever an ally or enemy is defeated, you can choose to either save them or
sacrifice them. Saving an enemy will heal a bit of your health, while
sacrificing them restores charges needed to cast magic. Similarly, you can also
choose to sacrifice parts of your character's own body in order to cast a
powerful spell with a varying effect depending on the body part sacrificed, but
doing so also incurs a negative status effect that lasts until the body part is
restored.

## 4 {% include game.html game="Demon Gaze" %}

Demon Gaze is another first-person dungeon crawler, with turn-based battles and
the usual dungeon-crawler RPG elements. There sure are a lot of dungeon crawlers
on the system! I'm primarily interested in Demon Gaze due to its Vita
exclusivity. Whether or not I end up playing all the way through is another
story! If I do enjoy the game, it does have a sequel that is also exclusive to
the Vita.

## 3 {% include game.html game="Oreshika Tainted Bloodlines" %}

Featuring a striking Japanese watercolor art style and turn-based RPG battles,
Oreshika: Tainted Bloodlines has some interesting ideas to offer. You explore
dungeons and fight monsters, and in doing this you accumulate points that allow
your characters to marry deities and have a child with them. It sounds like
these children are then added to your party. Your characters all have a finite
lifespan, so your playthrough will span generations of characters. It sounds
like an interesting enough premise, and the art style has really gotten my
attention as well!

## 2 {% include game.html game="Muramasa Rebirth" %}

A remake of the Wii original, Muramasa Rebirth is an action RPG from
Vanillaware. I loved Odin Sphere Leifthrasir, another Vanillaware title on the
Vita, and Muramasa should have similar hack 'n' slash action, combined with nice
RPG mechanics like inventory management, and level-ups. Couple that with the
beautiful, recognizeable Vanillaware art style, and Muramasa should be quite a
treat!

## 1 {% include game.html game="Tales of Hearts R" %}

I've enjoyed most of the Tales games I've played. The only 2 that didn't
wholeheartedly enjoy were Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World on the Wii,
and Tales of Zestiria on the PC. Zestiria's battle system and story never
clicked with me, but I found when I replayed Dawn of the New World on the PS3
re-release "Tales of Symphonia Chronicles" I actually had a good time with it.
As a fan of the series, playing Tales of Hearts R is an obvious choice, and I'm
looking forward to experiencing a Tales game I haven't played or read much about
before!

Technically, Tales of Hearts R isn't a Vita exclusive since it was available on
iOS in Japan for a period from 2013 to 2016 when it was pulled from the App
Store. But the iOS version was Japan only, plus it's not even available for
purchase anymore, so it's still a Vita exclusive in my book!
