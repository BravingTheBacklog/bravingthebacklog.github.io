I continued my re-obsession with Animal Crossing, and made some good progress in
Persona Q2 and Fire Emblem Echoes this week!

things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Games contained within this post:

### Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth *(3DS)*

I completed the Sci-Fi movie dungeon. The dungeon boss was pretty annoying to be
honest, because the battle centers around their ability to heal themselves by
about a third of their health in one turn. You have to get around this by
attacking them with a specific element that Oracle tells you to use, and the
element changes each turn. In the end, this battle dragged on too much for my
taste, but I made it.

The next, and seemingly final dungeon is a musical movie. Reminds me of The
Wizard of Oz and Cuphead. It has some interesting things going on, namely the
Stage Lifts. Basically, there are multiples connections between two floors, and
you need to go between the floors from various different points. This mechanic
is interesting without being tedious! Definitely an improvement over some of the
dungeons mechanics in the first game.

### Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia *(3DS)*

With Celica's army, I've gathered a few new teammates, like Atlas and Est. Est
is interesting because she mentions shes from the continent of Archanea, which
is where Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and Awakening take place.

As Alm, I've also gathered some new companions, like the Paladin Mathilda and
the Mage siblings Luthier and Delthea.

I've been progressing the main story with both characters, and it remains
interesting. I won't spoil anything, but I have made it into Act 4, and it seems
like things are beginning to wrap up...? Or at least, I think I can vaguely see
the conclusion we're heading for, but I'll see what curveballs the plot throws
my way as I get closer to the end.

### Animal Crossing: New Leaf *(3DS)*

Fishing was pretty fruitful this week, at least for progressing my museum. I
caught frogs, giant trevally, a rare arowana, a rare dorado, and a giant
snakehead!

I finally went all in on the biggest money maker in New Leaf...rare beetles.
I've been watching a bit of PB & Jeff's New Leaf Let's Play on YouTube, and from
there learned that you can make *tons* of bells by going to the island at night
and catching beetles. After reading a bit of an article online to figure out how
to prepare my island for maximum beetle spawns, I was ready. They weren't
kidding around...this method makes you so many bells. Beetles like the golden
stag and horned hercules sell for 12,000 bells a pop! Their high price is
balanced by the fact that they're really easy to scare off, you need to sneak
*slowly* with your net to avoid driving them away.

After catching a bunch of beetles and selling them, I had a pretty 600,000 bells
to my name. I decided to invest some of that into turnips and play the Stalk
Market, so I bought 3400 turnips over a few transactions with Joan, and threw
them into my house. Hopefully I get a good selling price this week, I'll be
checking diligently!

I tried a tour on the island for the first time. These are little missions that
might be random, I'm not sure since it was my first time trying one out. The
mission I chose was an Easy Ore-Hunter Tour, where I had 4 minutes to break
rocks and collect ore from them. Each ore was worth 1 point, except Amethyst
were worth 3 points. In the end, I managed to collect 24 points worth of ores,
for which Tortimer awarded me 6 medals. I guess you can use the medals to buy
things on the island. While I was there, they had a wet suit for sale for 48
medals...I guess I need to save up for that!

Also, a shoe store opened in my town this week! It's called Kicks, and it's run
by a Skunk of the same name. That's a good thing in New Leaf, the ability to
customize your character's socks and shoes. Kicks carries both varieties of
footwear, and like the other stores, the inventory changes each day.
