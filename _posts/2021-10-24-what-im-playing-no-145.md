Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

**Spoiler warning for Lufia II**, I spoil some late game bosses. I don't spoil
the ending though.

### Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals *(SNES)*    {#LufiaII:RiseoftheSinistrals}

I finished Lufia II this week! Towards the end of the game, there were a lot
fewer puzzles in the last few dungeons. The story is really going places at that
point, so I think fewer puzzles in the dungeons helped keep the pace consistent.
The final chunk of the game was sort of like a boss rush mode, where you fought
some bosses from earlier in the game again. By this point, you've gotten really
strong equipment on the main character as part of the story, so it was easy to
steamroll through them. Dealing over 1000 damage in 1 hit against these
huge bosses was pretty awesome!

This is as good a time as any to bring up some of Lufia II's bugs. Most of the
bugs in the game are pretty harmless, things like text being garbled in the
equipment screen when you switch characters. It's a little annoying, but it's
harmless. But then the main story takes you to an area that suffers from
horrible graphical corruptions in the North American release of the game.
Apparently, it's really just the North American version of the game with this
bug. The collision in the area still works, and all the cutscenes play out as
normal, but you basically have to navigate around this glitchy area in the dark
in order to progress the story. I stumbled around blindly for a while before
looking up a map to figure out how to get where I needed to in the area.
Luckily, it's a very short section of the game, but definitely an unfortunate
bug.

</figure>

Other than that, Lufia II was a really good RPG. Some of the puzzles were by far
the hardest part, battles and bosses were usually easy in the main story. I'm
assuming there's some challenging optional bosses and/or dungeons here, because
that's usually a thing with RPGs, but I didn't look for them. My final time for
this one was 22:09.

### Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night *(PC)*    {#Bloodstained:RitualoftheNight}

The next game I played this week was Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. This
game is a Castlevania game in everything but name. Seriously, it was produced by
Koji "IGA" Igarashi, who used to work at Konami and worked on several
Castlevania games that helped define the metroidvania genre, including
Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. IGA left Konami in 2014, and founded his own
development studio, ArtPlay. In 2015, he launched a KickStarter campaign for
Bloodstained with the goal of creating a spiritual successor to Symphony of the
Night. It quickly became one of the most successful video game KickStarters
ever, raising over 11 times its original goal. Of course, raising lots of money
and aiming to follow in Symphony of the Night's footsteps are admirable goals,
but it doesn't mean much if the team doesn't deliver on those promises. Well,
I'm happy to say that they very much delivered!

<figure class="half">

</figure>

If you've played any of the Castlevania games IGA worked on, Bloodstained will
*instantly* feel familiar. The gameplay and setting are very, *very*
Castlevania, and there are numerous nods to the Castlevania franchise. There's a
library in the game run by a vampire who is clearly based on Alucard from
Symphony of the Night, and they even got Alucard's English voice actor, Robert
Belgrade, to voice him. And the room he's in is a direct clone of the shop room
from Symphony of the Night! For a fan of the series, little nods and references
like this are wonderful.

The similarities to Castlevania continue with Bloodstained's Shard system. This
is basically the same system as the Soul system from Aria of Sorrow, or the
similar systems from the Castlevania games that followed, where enemies have a
chance to drop their Shard when defeated. These Shards can be equipped to gain
new attacks, passive buffs, or even familiars. I really enjoy the familiars,
it's nice having a companion following you around, helping out in small ways,
dealing a little extra damage to enemies and bosses. All the Shards that give
you new attacks are cool too of course, but (as usual in these games) there are
*so many*, I usually just find one that I like and stick with it for a long
time. It's cool to have so many options though, there's definitely a *massive*
number of potential combinations to try, and tons of challenge run potential.

Moving onto the story, you play as Miriam, a Shardbinder. Shardbinders are
people who have had a demonic Shard fused with them using alchemy, and this
gives them the ability to absorb Shards from demons in order to gain powers.
Miriam's childhood friend, Gebel, is also a Shardbinder. Unlike Miriam, he seems
to have turned to using his powers for evil, summoning an enormous castle from
Hell that's *filled* with demons. Naturally, these demons begin by destroying a
nearby town, so the church is dispatched to deal with them, and they enlist the
help of Miriam. The story is pretty good, but it isn't the focus of this game.
It's basically just an excuse to get a huge demon-filled castle in play, to
faciliate the exploration and combat, and I'm totally fine with that.

</figure>

The castle is *huge* by the way. I don't know exactly how it compares to the
maps of the Castlevania series, but it definitely *feels* larger. Although
Symphony of the Night might be just as big if not bigger, but either way,
Bloodstained's map is *fun* to explore. There are fast travel points at pretty
regular intervals, so you don't have to trek through the entire castle over and
over again if you need to leave and restock your supplies. There are also items
you can buy that instantly warp you back to your home base outside the castle.
Those are nice in a pinch if you find yourself low on health and just need to
get out, or if you don't want to walk back to warp point.

</figure>

Since this is a metroidvania, there are also some areas you aren't able to reach
until you get upgrades, and then you can backtrack and use your new ability to
explore further. One of these abilities is the Double Jump, which understandably
opens up a lot of new areas. But all the other abilities are pretty creative.
There aren't a *lot* of them, but the few that are present here are pretty novel
ideas. One is a sort of ricochet teleport ability, where you aim a beam of light
that reflects off of walls and mirrors, and when you trigger it you teleport to
the end of the beam. It's pretty cool to line up a teleport reflecting off of
several mirrors, and then zip to the end of the beam instantly.

Something you may have noticed from the screenshots: the level of goofiness in
this game is pretty high. The Castlevania games were no strangers to this, with
some out of place weapons and equipment from time to time and anachronistic food
items like pizza, but Bloodstained takes it to another level. This is mainly
because certain equipment shows up on Miriam, so if you find a hat that looks
like a teddy bear and you equip it, she's going to look pretty silly for a
while. But hey, good armor is good armor. Some of the enemies are also pretty
"out there," like the giant cat enemies that summon fire and swat at you.
Apparently, these are based on the pets of some KickStarter backers. There was a
US$3,000 tier to get your pet added to the game as an enemy, and several of the
backers must have backed at that tier because there's about 5 enemies like this
in the game!

<figure class="half">

If dressing Miriam up in stupid hats and accesories isn't goofy enough for you,
there's also a character customization screen you find pretty early on. Here,
you can change her hair style and color, eye color, the color of her clothes,
and even her skin color.

For the most part, progression in Bloodstained felt really intuitive. It was
easy to see where I hadn't explored yet, and after getting new items it was
pretty easy to figure out where I needed to go next. There were two occasions
where I had wandered around clueless for a while though, and had to look up a
guide to proceed. One was midway through the game, and the other was closer to
end. The first one was the more irritating of the two, because I don't know how
you would figure it out on your own.

Aside from that, Bloodstained was an incredible experience! There's also a *ton*
of replay value here. There's a New Game+ mode where you can carry most of your
equipment and shards into a new playthrough, potentially on Hard or Nightmare
difficulty. There's a Classic mode that pays homage to the pre-Symphony of the
Night Castlevania games, altering the controls and mechanics to make Miriam feel
a lot like Simon from Castlevania on the NES. I'll probably never play through
Classic mode, but it's cool it exists! I played through a little bit of it and
they really nail the NES Castlevania feel.

So that's Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night in a nutshell. I really enjoyed this
game! If you've enjoyed the Castlevania series, you should definitely check out
Bloodstained. I've rambled on enough, so I won't go into detail, but the music
was really good too (composed by Castlevania series composer Michiru Yamane). My
final playtime was 11:36.
