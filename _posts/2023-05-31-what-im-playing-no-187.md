### Sackboy: A Big Adventure *(PS5)*    {#Sackboy:ABigAdventure}

Imagine you *are* Sackboy. You're rolling around, living your best life, when
all of a sudden this evil jester guy Vex shows up, kidnaps all your friends, and
sets his world domination plan in motion. What do you do? You go on a Big
Adventure to stop him, obviously! And there's one sound reverberating through
your mind the entire time. That's right, it's Britney Spears' 2003 hit single,
"Toxic."

Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a 2020 3D platformer released for PS4, PS5, and PC.
It's a very cute 3D platformer spinoff of the LittleBigPlanet series, but one of
the things I'm going to remember most about it are its licensed music levels.
There are only a couple of these in the game, so they're more the exception than
the norm, but you don't play through a platformer level set to Bruno Mars'
"Uptown Funk" and forget about it. These levels basically take the New Super
Mario Bros. "enemies-dance-to-the-beat" concept and crank it up to 11. The
entire level bops along to the beat, and the cannon flowers that shoot you to
the next area even wait for the beat so that everything's still synced to the
music. These levels feel like a weird fever dream sometimes. Like I mentioned in
the intro, there is a level set to Britney Spears' "Toxic," that's real. The
concept might sound gimmicky, but these were actually *really* fun, you can't
help but get a little hyped during these and it almost feels a bit like a rhythm
game. The only downside of all these songs being in the game is that it'll
probably be a nightmare for games preservation someday. I can easily see it not
being available digitally at some point due to licensing agreements expiring,
unless Sony Music has pulled some strings or something and that's the magical
loophole that protects Sackboy from the licensed music curse that's affected
many games in the past (RIP original Alan Wake release).

Alongside the memorable music levels, there's a very solid and enjoyable 3D
platformer here. It's a lot like Astro's Playroom, but it also reminds me of
Super Mario 3D World in a lot of ways, like how there are a few optional levels
that can only be played in co-op. On that note, it also has full 4-player co-op,
including local co-op, which is increasingly rare these days. It's not too
difficult, this isn't Super Meat Boy or any other hyper-difficult platformer,
but the platforming mechanics are fun. Sackboy has a flutter jump you can use in
mid-air to stay airborne a little longer to get a bit more lateral distance. He
also has a dodge that becomes a roll if you keep pressing the button, and you
can pick things up to carry and throw them, including other players if you're
playing in co-op. You can also grab onto certain sponge-like surfaces, usually
rotating or moving ones that you'll have to jump off of with the right timing.

Side note: whenever I saw Vex or heard anyone say his name in the cutscenes, all
I could think of is the early 2000's 3D platformer "Vexx," with two X's. I still
remember playing a bit of that game on GameCube back in the day and collecting
some corrupted hearts, or whatever its primary collectible was. Shoutout to all
the people who knew about Vexx *before* Matt McMuscles covered it on "What
Happened?"

There are plenty of collectibles and secrets in the levels, and some of them are
quite well hidden so you really have to keep your eyes peeled to spot them. The
costume pieces and emotes are all optional, although I would recommend
collecting at least a few so you have more things to mess around with in
character customization, but you are required to collect at least *some* of
Dreamer Orbs in the levels because you need them to unlock the gates before the
boss of each world. You can't get past them unless you've collected at least a
certain number of Dreamer Orbs. I thought these limits for these were very
reasonable, there was never a gate I reached where I hadn't collected enough
Orbs yet. It's balanced well enough that as long as you're making some effort to
find and collect a few pearls in each level, you shouldn't get stopped by any of
these gates along the way. But you don't need to worry about finding all of them
in every level if you don't want to, especially since some *can* be very well
hidden. Was there a level that I completed without finding any of the Dreamer
Orbs, despite trying to find some? Yes, yes there was.

Sackboy: A Big Adventure is fairly short, with only five worlds in its main
story and a sixth post-game world that unlocks after the credits roll. But
within those five worlds, you have a fun variety of levels to play through, with
a mix of basic platforming levels, auto-scrolling chase levels, and more, and
the variety combined with the short runtime keeps any of it from feeling stale
before you reach the end. My final time was about 7 hours to beat the main
story. I didn't try to do any of the post-game world because I saw immediately
that I wouldn't have enough Dreamer Orbs to get very far, but I imagine that
could easily add a few more hours onto the experience.
