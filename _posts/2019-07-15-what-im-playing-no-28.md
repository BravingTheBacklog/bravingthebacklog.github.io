Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Despite having started Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia after Persona Q2,
I finished Shadows of Valentia this week! I'd been playing more of Fire Emblem
Echoes since picking it up than Persona Q2, so I suppose it's not that
surprising.

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Games contained within this post:

 - Animal Crossing: New Leaf *(3DS)*
 - Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia *(3DS)*
 - Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth *(3DS)*

### Animal Crossing: New Leaf *(3DS)*

I had some more fruitful nighttime visits to the island this week. One of them
netted me quite a few Golden Stags, as well as my first whale shark which I
promptly donated to the museum!

Another night, I found Gulliver washed up on the shore. He woke up after boxes
of sleep talking dialogue, fired off a casual Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door
reference that I loved, and gave me a simple quiz to see if I could figure out
where he was headed before he went overboard. It was Australia. The next day, a
letter from him was waiting in my mailbox, with an attached Ayers Rock present.
I don't foresee myself using it to seriously decorate my house, but at the very
least it's another entry in my furniture catalog, I guess?

I also returned to the Shampoodle hair salon with enough bells to try it out
this time. After answering some questions about the style and color, I wound up
with this new hairstyle! ...I'm not really a fan of it to be honest, I'm so used
to seeing the Animal Crossing villager with just a simple, dark haircut, that
this is kind of a shock to see. I've been wearing the Samurai Helmet headgear
that covers my character's hair lately, so I'll probably forget what his hair
looks like soon enough anyway.

By the end of the week, I'd broken the 2 million bells mark in my savings
account! Very exciting! I'll have to spend a chunk of that soon to pay off my
debt or maybe do a public works project!

### Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia *(3DS)*

I finished Shadows of Valentia this week! The story remained strong through the
very end! The gameplay was likewise strong, there were some fun maps.

On the final trek toward the end of the game, I finally let units fall without
using Mila's Turnwheel to turn back time and save them. Luthier and Python both
didn't make it during the battle of Rigel Falls. Luthier was pretty useless to
me, his sister Delthea was the better Mage in my experience. Python was a little
harder let go, but in the end Tobin was my better archer so I could justify
carrying on without Python.

</figure>

The final dungeon was the longest in the main game, but it was split up nicely
by some story moments and sort of "mini-boss" battles. Plus, there were some
rooms in the middle where you could save, so I didn't have to worry too much
about having to replay a lot of it if I got a Game Over. It even had a few
puzzles where you entered a room with 4 warp points, and had to solve a simple
riddle to determine which was the one that would lead further on.

Eventually, I made it through the dungeon and reached the final boss battle! At
this point, you have access to both Alm and Celica during this battle, as well
as both their respective armies. There were a lot of strong enemies on that map,
and honestly few units in Celica's army were leveled up enough to hold their
own.

Keeping details vague to avoid spoilers, the final battle was a challenge, but
it felt pretty fair. I mean, as the final battle, I expect some stiff
resistance, even on Normal difficulty. I got a Game Over when Celica fell in
battle my first try, but luckily you can save right before it begins so you
don't need to go through the dungeon again.

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BD5W6jI.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BD5W6jIm.png"/></a>

On my second try, I still lost some units. Since it was the final battle though,
I was okay letting a few units fall. Deen, Delthea, Atlas, Forsyth, Tobin,
Kamui, and Faye all lost their lives during the final battle. *But*...none of
them were crucial to the strenghth of my army. If Golden Knight Zeke had fallen,
that would have been a totally different story. I would've used Mila's Turnwheel
to undo a turn or two to keep him alive without hesitation.

[![path to the continent of Archanea](https://i.imgur.com/uCwRyJMm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/uCwRyJM.png)
{: .image-right }

After beating the game, you can save your cleared game and keep playing if you
want. Loading this save file begins the post-game Act 6. You can revisit past
locations and fight random enemies, but the main draw here is that a path to the
continent of Archanea is now available. That's where the original Fire Emblem
and Awakening take place!

The path to Archanea was pretty cool. There are three battles en route, and
these were pretty strategically interesting. Two are against enemy ships, with
narrow gangplanks connecting them.

The last one had only 1 ship, surrounded by a wide margin of ocean tiles. None
of my units were fliers, since all my surviving Pegasus Knights were
underleveled, so my units were all limited to a very small space to move around.
Strong enemies start on the west side of the ship, so the action starts on the
very first turn. Meanwhile, flying enemies spawn in the corners of the map and
fly towards your ship. It was a lot to juggle, and I had to use Mila's Turnwheel
a few times to avoid deaths, but it was a fun map!

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RMnMFBu.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RMnMFBum.png"/></a>
</figure>

All of this leads you to make landfall on Archanea, at a small port town.
There's a Mila Altar and a Smithy in town, which is convenient to help you
prepare for the post-game dungeon: Thabes Labyrinth.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DOjnlIk.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DOjnlIkm.png" alt="a small port town"/>
    </a>
</figure>

This dungeon is the main post-game offering. There's no real post-game
narrative. You simply have the option to help a foreign Archanean merchant
return home, which kicks off the journey. Once you land in Archanea, you hear
about Thabes in the port town, and it's the only other location available. So
you're just sort of pushed into it. Most of the dungeons in the game weren't too
long, but this one...oof, it was long and the floors all felt a little samey.
Couple that with the normal dungeon enemy encounters, which can feel a bit
grindey, and I just didn't find the post-game experience to be very compelling.
I got a Game Over after Alm died during a battle around the 5th floor, meaning
I'd have to start from the beginning of the dungeon again if I wanted to see the
end of it. I wasn't that interested in what Thabes had to offer, so I decided I
was done with the post-game. Plus, after reading a guide online, I was only
halfway through Thabes anyway! It just wasn't worth it to me.

</figure>

On the whole, I enjoyed Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia quite a bit.
I'll be writing a review for it sometime soon. In the meantime though, know that
it does have my recommendation for sure! It's not perfect, but it is a unique
experience in the series, and worth a try for sure!

### Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth *(3DS)*

[![the 4th dungeon](https://i.imgur.com/vX0UNjim.png)](https://i.imgur.com/vX0UNji.png)
{: .image-right }

I completed the 4th dungeon! It was 8 floors in total from what I remember,
making it the longest dungeon yet! But I hadn't really grown tired of it by the
end. I did pace myself pretty slowly on this one, so that may have helped. It
actually seemed like just the right length.

The boss at the end of this dungeon was a pretty good one. No overly annoying
methods were required to beat it, making it more enjoyable than the boss of the
3rd dungeon. The gimmick here was that the boss had 3 appendages, and a set of
eyes that moved between them each turn. You could only deal damage to the boss
if you attacked the spot the eyes were, and it had different attacks at its
disposal depending on which appendage currently had the eyes. I thought this was
a solid boss design. It would have been pretty tough if I hadn't been playing on
Safety mode, since I had to revive my whole party 3 times, but as it was I
actually thought this boss was okay.

</figure>

Afterward, the key to the final lock on the exit doors was mine! In the back of
my mind, it seemed too good to be true. Things just didn't *quite* seem
resolved.

</figure>

Sure enough, that wasn't the final dungeon. There's one last dungeon to face!
This one features heavy winds that function sort of like conveyor belts. If you
step into the wind's path, it'll blow you in that direction until you hit a
wall. I'm not too far into the dungeon yet, but it seems like the blowing wind
will make drawing my map on the bottom screen especially important to keep track
of where the wind is and where it will take my party if I step into it!
