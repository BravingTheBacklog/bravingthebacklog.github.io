### Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town *(Switch)*    {#StoryofSeasons:FriendsofMineralTown}

I don't really have anything to report for this one. I played it for a bit this
week but (surprisingly) didn't take many screenshots. It's a really nice game to
chill out and play for a bit. I learned how to meet with the Harvest Goddess
from a tips video on YouTube, that was pretty neat. Apparently you just have to
throw offerings into her spring. If you give her enough gifts she gives you
several rewards, but I haven't gotten to that point yet. Also, some of the
character sprites are rather...uh...expressive!

### Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology *(3DS)*    {#RadiantHistoria:PerfectChronology}

The road to the credits of Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology was a long one,
but I finally did it! That might make it seem like I was growing tired of this
game, but that's not true. I really enjoyed Radiant Historia, though it was
sometimes tedious and a bit frustrating.

What surprised me about "finishing the game" is that in Perfect Chronology, you
don't get a credits sequence after beating the original story. At that point,
since I was playing in Append Mode, the new story content added in Perfect
Chronology was unlocked. As far as I can tell, beating that new story content is
the only way to get to the credits of the game, which is something I wanted to
do to feel like I really finished the game. Except at that point, I was content
with the story's conclusion. Had the credits rolled then, I probably would have
stopped playing and considered my playthrough complete. But there were no
credits there, and I was curious to see how the new story content would pan out,
so I continued playing.

The new content focuses on a new character, Nemesia. If I had elected to play
the game in "Perfect Mode," rather than Append Mode, her new scenes and the new
gameplay elements would have happened as I played through the game. In Append
Mode, they're instead summarized after you complete the original story. It was
nice seeing where they fit into the original plot, but I can definitely see why
Append Mode is the recommended setting for players who haven't played Radiant
Historia. The plot of the base game is *really* good, and having the few Nemesia
scenes interrupt it would have been an unnecessary distraction.

Anyway, the main gameplay loop added in Perfect Chronology is retrieving
Artifacts for Nemesia from across various "possible worlds," which are like
parallel timelines to the ones Stocke has been exploring thus far.
Gameplay-wise, Nemesia has a mission board that you accept missions from and
complete them for rewards. Each one results in Stocke traveling to some
alternate world where events played out slightly differently from his timelines
and retrieving an Artifact for Nemesia. Sometimes you'll encounter roadblocks
and need to travel to some point in time in one of the Stocke's original
timelines in order to get an item or something to advance. Sometimes you just
have to fight an enemy. None of the missions involve much exploring or anything
like that, they're pretty short and focused.

The problem with playing these missions in Append Mode is that the difficulty of
them is balanced assuming you'd play them as you progress through the main
story, so any I fought with my team during these missions were *really* easy.
Playing the missions like this in Append Mode wasn't particularly compelling.
Luckily, to get the ending of the game you only need to do the ones marked with
a key, although completing all of them is required for one of the game's
endings, but I'm not going for that one at this time. Some of the scenarios of
the possible worlds were sort of interesting, but none of it comes close to how
gripping the main story is.

Nemesia provides more backstory on the history of the world as you complete
Artifact missions, and eventually you unlock a new dungeon that leads to the new
ending. This part was done really well. It's a little rushed compared to how you
learn about the world in the original story, but the details tie everything
together nicely, and fill in some questions I'd had in the back of my mind after
the original ending. The second to last boss battle of this final dungeon was
*really* intense. It hit my team really hard with strong magic attacks that
could paralyze the whole party if I was unlucky. That was pretty nasty, but once
I figured out it was weak to magic I was able to defeat it pretty easily. The 5
game overs it took to realize that were a bit frustrating though.

All in all, Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology is a fantastic game. Most of
its strongest story moments are in roughly the first half of the game. After
that the story is still quite good, but everything before that is just
*fantastic*. The endings require completing all the "key" side quests, and some
of these are hard to find. Without using a guide, I probably never would have
found out how to start one of them. The battle system is awesome, I never got
tired of it. Even when getting completely obliterated by difficult bosses, the
battle system is so good that I wanted to keep playing, and figure out a way to
use it more effectively. That about wraps up my final thoughts on Radiant
Historia. It has its flaws, but I think it's an absolute treasure even so!
