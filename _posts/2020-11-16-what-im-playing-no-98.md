Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Oxygen Not Included *(PC)*    {#OxygenNotIncluded}

On a whim, I started playing this space colony management sim a bit this week. I
had played it before about 2 years ago, and since then a significant number of
free content updates have rolled out. I thought the simulation felt pretty
feature complete before, but now there are even more fun layers to the
experience! Plus, I think the achievements are new - I don't remember those
existing last time I played, so that's pretty cool!

Rather than jump back into my old save and struggle to remember all the
mechanics, I started a new colony. It had the random name "Trainwreck," which is
about how I expect things to end up in the colony sooner or later so I kept it.
You start with just 3 duplicants, the humanoid residents of the colony. They do
your every bidding, and execute orders to dig through dirt, build new
structures, sweet up debris on the ground, and all other manner of tasks. Every
few in-game days (called "cycles"), you'll be able to print a new duplicant with
a fancy machine that's basically a 3D printer. You get a few options to choose
from, or you can instead choose a resource care package if you're not ready to
expand your colony just yet, since more duplicants means more mouths to feed and
more lungs consuming oxygen. I *think* the skill trees that each duplicant has
are new since I last played too.

The depth of the simulation here is pretty awesome. You need to lay down power
infrastructure, as well as plumbing, airflow, hygiene, food production...the
list goes on. There are *tons* of aspects to tweak to maximize colony
efficiency, so if you're into that sort of thing this game will be a dream come
true. I like the gameplay and visuals are 2D too, they're quite charming. I
didn't play for that long, but I managed to make it to cycle 15 and I only
caused 1 duplicant death along the way, so despite the colony name I'd say
things are going pretty well so far!

### Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin *(PS4)*    {#Sakuna:OfRiceandRuin}

This game released on PC, Switch, and PS4 this week. I picked up the physical
collector's edition for PS4, because the game looked interesting and the
collector's edition was priced at only $60. At that price, I couldn't pass it
up! This netted me a copy of the 3 disc soundtrack, an art book, a lucky charm,
and the game. Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is a combination of farming sim and 2D
action platformer, and since I've enjoyed games from both genres in the past, I
definitely wanted to try this one out!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Y4KWYsf.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y4KWYsfm.jpg" alt="This game"/></a>

</figure>

The premise here is that Sakuna, a harvest goddess who's become lazy and
self-centered due to years of living off her inheritance, is exiled from her
home in the capital of the Lofty Realm after a run in with some humans who
stumbled into the realm of the gods leads her to accidentally burn down the
storehouse. She is banished to the Isle of Demons, along with the group of
humans involved in the incident, and tasked with investigating the source of
demons on the island.

</figure>

Her mother and father once had a homestead on the Isle of Demons, so Sakuna and
her group of human companions quickly make that their base of operations. To
avoid starvation, they begin growing rice, with Sakuna (and therefore the
player) doing most of the work. While the rice grows, Sakuna is tasked with
going out to hunt demons, yielding meat and other materials. Though initially
adverse to both tasks, over the years spent on the island, Sakuna develops a
sense of duty and compassion, though she still retains her ego-centric demeanor.

Before I go into a huge essay on how cool and deep the rice-farming mechanics
are, here's a quick example of what combat is like. You have light and heavy
attacks at your disposal, as well as a multitude of combat skills that cost SP.
Furthermore, you can parry enemy attacks with proper timing, and using Sakuna's
Divine Raiment, swing around behind enemies to dodge attacks and gain the upper
hand. A large part of combat with regular enemies also consists of knocking
enemies into each other to cause a chain reaction and deal major damage. What's
interesting is that you don't level up from defeating enemies. You can increase
the level of your combat skills by using them, but you don't increase your stats
by fighting demons. Since Sakuna is a harvest goddess, she only gains power one
way: through successful harvests.

There are a lot of phases during a rice crop's life cycle. Luckily, they're not
all introduced at once, and the game has tutorials that help you get started and
keep you on the right track. Naturally, you start by planting the rice, and once
it's planted, you'll pull weeds as it grows, and adjust the water level in your
field as the rice grows. Then you'll learn about creating and applying
fertilizer, and work that into your routine. Eventually, you have access to a
variety of in-game scrolls that teach you about the finer points of rice
farming, and help you to maximize either the size or quality of your harvest.

Once the rice has matured and ripened, you harvest it, dry it, then move it to
the storehouse for threshing and hulling. As you perform these tasks, you gain
farming experience, and eventually learn new farming skills that allow you to
complete tasks faster, making it easier to handle the larger harvests you'll
likely be seeing after a few years. Like with other farming sims, you'll settle
into a satisfying and relaxing routine after enough time. It may seem like
there's a lot to manage, but you can make mistakes and still have a successful
crop, and make incremental improvements to your process as you go.

</figure>

After you finish hulling the year's rice crop, the harvest is added to your food
stores, and Sakuna's level will increase to match that of the rice, with her
stats increasing in relation to the attributes of the rice as well. You get a
nice summary of the status of your crop at this point too, helping you plan for
your next year. The rice continues to benefit you after harvest, as it makes for
filling meals at dinner, and can be used in many dishes.

I've really enjoyed my time with Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin so far. The way the
rice farming directly benefits your prowess in combat is really satisfying.
Having trouble with a boss? Just focus on your rice for a bit, have a bountiful
harvest, and come back stronger than ever before to destroy the demons. Combat
also ties into the farming mechanics nicely, as some of the materials you find
can be used to make better fertilizer. In addition to this, you also have
standard action RPG mechanics like forging stronger gear, which is also done
using materials gathered during exploration. The gameplay loop gets a bit grindy
from time to time, since you'll sometimes be visiting the same set of areas over
and over to complete exploration objectives in order to unlock the next area,
but even then it's still fun, because you'll be gathering materials that help
you back on the farm, or that help you craft stronger weapons.
