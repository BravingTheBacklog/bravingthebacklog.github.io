Hello! This is PatronusLight and I am posting my first official article! Today I
will be tackling The Sims 4 Dream Home Decorator Game Pack. I have bought most
of the Expansion, Game, and Stuff Packs as they come out and immediately try it
out. The only Packs I waited to purchase were some Stuff Packs. I own none of
the Kits. Since it has been out for almost a month I'm ready to talk about my
experience with it.

Based on the trailer, The Sims 4 Dream Home Decorator Game Pack is supposed to
be exciting with beautiful reveal before and after photos and speaking with the
clients afterward to see how they react in a new career. I did not experience
this.

Prior to new Packs I usually make a new character and while I waited for Dream
Home Decorator I had her max out the Singing skill (courtesy of the City Living
Expansion Pack) and Piano skill. I had her write lyrics and songs and license
them to start making money. At this time I turned off gaining fame (courtesy of
the Get Famous Expansion Pack).

First things first: immediate bugs. My very first gig was a room renovation in
StrangerVille (courtesy of the StrangerVille Game Pack) with an auto-generated
townie in a studio set up home. I followed the townie's likes and dislikes as
well as I could and even made room for a treadmill with their limited room and
money since they liked fitness as well as a TV! Though the reveal worked
correctly, they looked around the room and shook their head disappointedly at
the items I showed them. I was paid 0 simoleons. I personally felt like crying
after this and needed to be comforted by bsinky. After their dislike I
immediately went into Manage Worlds and destroyed their house's interior.

Regardless, I went ahead and searched for another gig and booked another room
renovation with the Caliente family in Oasis Springs. This time I did a little
cheating and went into Manage Worlds and edited their family. I went to their
likes and made all of them like the color blue. They also gave me the color
brown. When I went in for the renovation I made everything blue and one family
member told me they liked violin so I plopped a violin in too. This time the
family loved it: the reveal worked appropriately and I got paid.

My next gig with the Pancakes in Willow Creek went well without cheating this
time. I used their given likes and made their dining room very pink for Eliza. I
made it an even more expensive pink room with their generous budget and added a
microwave and yellow for Bob since he likes cooking and yellow. The reveal took
place and they were both pleased.

I then did a simple kitchen renovation for the Nishidake household in Mt.
Komorebi (courtesy of the Snowy Escape Expansion Pack) that went well too.

My next gig was another room renovation but for the Goth family in Willow Creek
this time. I once again did a little cheating and made everyone like the colors
black and red. They also gave me a specific decor style that they liked. I
renovated a bathroom using the color AND decor style they asked for. This was
another dud: the reveal did not work and I received no money. I went back to
their house in Manage Worlds and deleted the entire room. One less bathroom for
them!

A few days ago a Sims YouTuber [James Turner posted a
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u_frp33W9o) where he couldn't do any
sort of actual renovation and plopped one item down from what he learned from
the family's likes and the family loved it anyway. I've watched his Dream Home
Decorator series so far and have seen a lot of problems that others are
experiencing as well. I just don't understand this Packs logic.

During this time I had my sim build up her Acting skill (courtesy of the Get
Famous Expansion Pack) and was prepared to switch careers if I encountered
another bug or became bored.

Since I was not receiving any reputation due to failure of gigs, I used [the MC
Command Center mod](https://deaderpool-mccc.com/) and cheated myself up in the
career to obtain better gigs. I booked a Gym Renovation for the gym in Willow
Creek. I took my before photos of the main floor and one of the upper floor.
Once I went into Build Mode I learned that I could not make changes to the upper
floor. No big deal. I went ahead and deleted everything and added gym equipment
from the Fitness Stuff Pack and threw in the B64 Training Bot from the
StrangerVille Game Pack which no townie will probably use. The client liked
purple so I put in as much purple as I could. They also liked the skiing skill
(courtesy of Snowy Escape Expansion Pack) so I put in some purple ski equipment
which can't be used but is there for the client's likes. This reveal worked and
the client was happy.

After this renovation I did one more renovation of a living room for the Tinker
family in Evergreen Harbor (courtesy of the Eco Lifestyle Pack). They liked blue
as well. I made the renovation and though I was paid, I did not get the before
and after reveal or chat with the client.

Due to this final bug, I switched careers and my sim is currently thriving in
the Actor career (courtesy of the Get Famous Expansion Pack). Fame is now turned
on and she is climbing to becoming a 5 Star Celebrity.

Overall I am deeply disappointed in this Pack. I enjoyed renovating rooms before
this Pack and may continue to do so on my own but not as a part of this Pack's
career.
