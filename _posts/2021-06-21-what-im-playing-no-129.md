Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

I only played one game this week, and my coverage on it is spoiler-free.

### Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga *(PS2)*    {#ShinMegamiTensei:DigitalDevilSaga}

Following Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne on PS2, Atlus released the Digital
Devil Saga games, a spin-off duology with similar mechanics and graphics to
Nocturne, but without some of the core SMT elements. Playing Nocturne and the
recent official confirmation of Shin Megami Tensei V's release date has me on an
SMT kick, so I decided to play Digital Devil Saga next!

So I actually went into this a little spoiled on some plot reveals just by
reading some of the first paragraphs from the game's Wikipedia page. I've still
been enjoying it, but when I *do* get to the part that Wikipedia spoiled it
probably won't have the same impact. I'll avoid spoiling anything though!

Set in a war-torn world called the Junkyard, you control Serph and a close team
of his allies. Serph is the leader of one of the Junkyard's tribes, who are all
endlessly at war with one another. Their world is forever changed when a strange
light passes through them during battle one day, giving them and most others the
ability to transform into powerful demons. With this power comes a price - they
must devour their enemies in order to sustain themselves. At the same time, they
rescue a mysterious amnesiac girl from the battlefield that day, Sera. Others
granted the power to transform into demons soon begin to lose their minds, but
Sera is able to keep Serph and his friends in their right minds by singing a
strange song. Further confusing matters, the leaders of the tribes are all
summoned to Sahasrara, a tower in the center of the Junkyard that ascends to the
heavens. There, they are addressed by a strange voice that tells them they can
learn the truth by killing the other leaders, and ascending the tower to reach
Nirvana.

That's the basic plot setup. One neat thing to note is that important cutscenes
are fully voiced. For the era, the voice acting is pretty good. None of it is
awful, but some characters are definitely better than others. It's cool that
this game has voice acting in its original release, whereas Nocturne, which
released just a few years earlier on PS2, didn't have voice acting until its
recent HD Remaster.

Like Nocturne, gameplay consists of dungeon crawling and turn-based battles
initiated through random encounters. Unlike other SMT games, you don't recruit
demons for your party though, and you don't fuse demons or anything. Instead,
it's more like a traditional RPG, where specific characters make up your party.
In this case, you control Serph's allies. The Press Turn system from Nocturne
and later SMT games is here though! Hitting enemy weaknesses gains you extra
turns, and you lose turns if your attack is blocked, absorbed, or misses. The
enemies you fight in battle are members of other tribes who have transformed
into demons, and they take the form of familiar demons from SMT, like Succubus,
Apsaras, and tons of others.

There are some notable differences in the battle system besides it not having
demon recruitment. There are 2 new elemental types of attacks, "gun," and
"earth." So far, it seems you can only use gun attacks when in human form in
battle, while earth attacks work the same as the other elements, and you use
those as magic spells. You can also unleash combo attacks if the members of your
party know one of the required combinations of spells. These take up 1 turn per
participating member, but can be quite useful to hit enemy weaknesses. The last
major difference I can think of is that spells to temporarily protect elemental
weaknesses are quite common. I don't know if spells like that were even in
Nocturne, but in Digital Devil Saga they're common enough to be part of the
early game tutorials, and they're quite useful if you know what type of
elemental attack an enemy will use. For example, if you're fighting an enemy who
uses ice magic, you can cast Void Ice on your turn to negate the next ice attack
each member of the party takes. If the enemy then uses ice on the following
turn, it will be nulled, and they'll lose a turn. Things like that add some
interesting layers to combat, even against regular enemies.

Other small improvements were made since Nocturne too, like the addition of a
minimap while exploring. Stats for the main character are customized upon level
up just as they were in Nocturne, but the way you customize your combat skills
is different. You can master an unlimited number of skills, but you can only set
a limited number of them to be useable in battle at a given time. You master
skills by equipping a Mantra, which you purchase from a "skill tree" of sorts,
where you can only purchase and equip higher level Mantra by first mastering the
prerequisite Mantra. Anyone can purchase any Mantra though, so you could have
the whole team use fire magic if you really wanted. I wouldn't recommend it
though, since you wouldn't be able to hit any other elemental weaknesses.

Digital Devil Saga has been really good so far. Just like Nocturne, my least
favorite part is probably the random encounters. Sometimes you can't walk 3
steps without another battle starting! It's not a big deal most of the time
though, because battles are really fun. The dungeons aren't as intense as
Nocturne's were, at least not so far. Some of Nocturne's dungeons were *brutal*!
Overall, it's definitely a more approachable game than Nocturne - which is
exactly what the developers set out to make, and I'd say they did a great job!
I'm looking forward to seeing where the story goes, and I what ends up happening
to these characters. Plus, this game is just the first half of the story. It's
concluded in the sequel, Digital Devil Saga 2, and there's a strong chance I'll
go straight into that one after this!
