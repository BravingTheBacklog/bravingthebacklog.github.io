Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Games contained within this post:

 - Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth *(3DS)*

### Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth *(3DS)*

This week, I finished exploring the dino-filled Junessic Land dungeon. It was
fun...for the most part anyway.

<figure class="third center">

    </a>
</figure>

After reaching the end of Junessic Land, there's a boss battle...and man, that
boss is *tough*. I first attempted it on normal difficulty. My party was
promptly wiped out. I then attempted it on Easy difficulty. My party was
promptly wiped out. The boss starts out easy, but eventually he gets 3 other
cronies to back him up. They cronies cast buffs on him, and he begins using
Confusion-inflicting moves that can target your entire party, and uses more
powerful damaging attacks too! It was a bit much for me, personally. After
switching to the Safety difficulty, where you can fully revive your team if you
fall in battle, with no consequences, I was finally able to cheese my way
through this fight. The boss and his cronies still took my team down 3 times
though. Sheesh.

Another lock on the exit door unlocked, 2 left!

The next dungeon is a futuristic, sci-fi themed one. Here, I've encountered the
characters from Persona 3, and they've joined my party. This brings the total
number of available party members to a whopping 23! Since you can only have 5
people in your active party at once, this allows for a lot of different party
combinations. It's a little overwhelming, but I'm mostly sticking with the party
I'd already been using, since only the characters in your party gain experience
and level up. Although, I did add Shinjiro to my party since he has no elemental
weaknesses, and was around the same level as current party members.

</figure>

I've continued playing on Safety difficulty after that boss battle in Junessic
Land. The battle system in this game just isn't something I feel like really
having to try at anymore, so I'm just going to lean on Safety and revive my
party whenever they get wiped out in battle. I'm playing for the characters more
than anything else.

Playing just one Persona game this week is hardly enough, right? Which brings us
to the next game...

### Persona 4: Dancing All Night *(PS4)*

I played through the Story mode here this week. Really I was just playing the
dances, I skipped all the dialogue bits since I've played the Story before on
the Vita. The Story Mode dances can only be played on Easy or Normal, so they
weren't a challenge. They were still fun to watch and listen to while playing
though.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/E8rbhwE.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/E8rbhwEm.jpg" alt="so they weren't a challenge"/></a>
</figure>

The main reason I replayed the Story was to unlock All Night difficulty. You
need to buy all items at the in-game store to do so, and you can't buy one of
those until you finish the Story. With All Night unlocked, I could finally play
Free Dance on All Night difficulty. It's so much fun!

### Cadence of Hyrule - Crypt of the NecroDancer Featuring The Legend of Zelda *(Switch)*

[![Cadence of Hyrule - Crypt of the NecroDancer Featuring The Legend of Zelda](https://i.imgur.com/nx3XH3hm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/nx3XH3h.jpg)
{: .image-right }

I've enjoyed playing Crypt of the NecroDancer pretty casually on PC. I'm not
very good, but I *love* the concept. It's basically a combination of rhythm game
and roguelike. So when I saw Cadence of Hyrule - Crypt of the NecroDancer
Featuring The Legend of Zelda (what a title, huh?) announced some time ago, I
was blown away! It came out this week, and it's everything the title promises -
Crypt of the NecroDancer mixed with The Legend of Zelda.

The premise here is that the evil Octavo has taken over Hyrule Castle and spread
all sorts of nastiness across the land. You need to defeat his guardians hidden
in four dungeons around Hyrule in order to gain access to the castle and defeat
him.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

After a *very* brief but effective tutorial where you play as Cadence (the main
character of Crypt of the NecroDancer) after she finds herself mysteriously
teleported to Hyrule, you have a choice to play as either Link or Zelda. I
picked Link, but it's really cool that you have the option to play as Zelda! You
can unlock whoever you didn't pick, and Cadence, by finding them during your
playthrough, so you're not locked into one single character for your entire run.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

Like Crypt of the NecroDancer, the gameplay can be pretty challenging at times!
I got a number of Game Overs early on when I had just a few hearts and wasn't
that familiar with enemy movement patterns. Luckily, dying is penalized pretty
fairly. You lose common equipment, like rupees, your shovel, torch, etc., but
you get to keep certain permanent upgrades like diamonds, your shield,
boomerang, bombs, and so on. You can also respawn at any Sheikah Stone you've
previously unlocked, so it doesn't feel like starting over after each death.

The pixel art Hyrule looks great. It seems like they drew lots of inspiration
from A Link to the Past, but its also infused with the unique charm Crypt of the
NecroDancer has. A common enemy in the series, Bokoblins, for instance raise
their arms before they move, and it's a pretty cute little dance move. This is
the same as the zombie enemies in Crypt of the NecroDancer, but it works well
for the Bokoblins here too.

</figure>

There's also co-op, but I haven't tried that yet! You can either start a New
Game in co-op right away, or play co-op on a 1 player save once you unlock
another hero.

My exploration took me to the Lost Woods first, and after traversing it using
the Tingle Dowser, I reached my first dungeon, Lost Swamp! As my first taste of
a real dungeon in Cadence of Hyrule, it was excellent! You get a mini-map of the
dungeon floor you're currently on. The dungeon was separated into 3 different
levels, and once you unlocked one you could return directly to that level even
after dying. This was *really* nice, because I did die a number of times when
attempting the levels! Eventually, you'll find the Boss Key and be able to
unlock the door to the boss. The dungeon felt a lot like Crypt of the
NecroDancer's levels, except you don't have to restart from the first floor of
the dungeon every time if you die.

The first boss I faced was Gohmaracas, a Queen Gohma-inspired maraca guardian!
Its attack patterns weren't too difficult for me at this point. I was well
equipped, and it didn't have too much health anyway. After defeating Gohmaracas,
the magical Maracas were mine!

After that, I explored the overworld a lot more. Found Kakariko Village, where I
found and unlocked Zelda, Death Mountain, and picked up a few upgrades like the
Deku Leaf and a Bottle on the way.

Eventually, I reached another dungeon - Gerudo Ruins. This was the fire-themed
dungeon, and it had a bunch of Stalfos and some gecko-like enemies that turned
to stone when you hit them. I'm not sure what those are really called. I was
really well equipped at this point, so the dungeon was a breeze. Octavo again
awaited at the end, and brought the Bass Guitarmos Knights to life! I had enough
heart containers and a strong enough weapon here that they were no threat. After
defeating them, the Bass Guitar was mine!

By then, I'd explored most of the map, so I pretty much knew where to find the
last two dungeons. The Frozen Grotto held the guardian Wizzroboe, whom I
defeated to claim the magical Oboe. The Temple of Storms held Gleeokenspiel,
which I defeated and claimed the final magical instrument, the Glockenspiel!

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ka3juMo.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ka3juMom.jpg" alt="Gleeokenspiel"/></a>
</figure>

With the four guardians defeated, it was time to take on Hyrule Castle and
challenge Octavo himself!

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ByEORBj.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ByEORBjm.jpg" alt="Hyrule Castle"/>
    </a>
</figure>

Without spoiling too much, I'll say that the final battle was great! Octavo
summons pieces of the four guardians, and it's sort of like a boss rush while
you try to damage Octavo as he teleports around as well. There's also a really
cool part where all three playable characters are controllable at once, as the
other two show up to help you during the final showdown!

    </div>
</figure>

In the end, Link and Zelda use their pieces of the Triforce to send Cadence back
to her own world, and all is well in Hyrule once again!

<figure class="half center">

I'm looking forward to writing a review for Cadence of Hyrule soon! Developer
Brace Yourself Games has done fantastic work here. They absolutely the Legend of
Zelda franchise justice. I will for sure be playing another run eventually!
There are leaderboards for fastest completion time and fewest steps, and my time
of a little over 4 hours is *super* slow compared to the top scores at the time!
I have to step up my game, I guess!
