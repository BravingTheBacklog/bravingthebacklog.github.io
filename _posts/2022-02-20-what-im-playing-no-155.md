### The Sexy Brutale *(PC)*    {#TheSexyBrutale}

The Sexy Brutale is a casino and mansion known for its annual masquerade. But
this year, things at the party are very, very wrong. The guests are unknowingly
trapped in a time loop, and every twelve hours they are murdered by the staff
one by one until the loop resets and the same day repeats itself. But with the
help of a mysterious woman without skin, you, Lafcadio Boone, are now aware of
the loop, and have gained the power to alter its course. Only you can solve the
mysteries of the mansion, and save the lives trapped within!

At its heart, The Sexy Brutale is a point and click adventure game, but its
story and mechanics make it something special. The game opens with a short
tutorial that teaches you the ropes of its investigation and time loop
mechanics, explaining how you can reset to the beginning of the loop whenever
you want, how to peek through keyholes, and how to focus your hearing. These
three mechanics are the keys to figuring out how to save the mansion's guests
from their doom. Using all these abilities together, you'll gradually figure out
the guests' schedules for the day, and begin piecing together a way to prevent
their deaths.

Of course, something that makes the situation more challenging is that you can
only be in the same room as another person if you are hidden in a wardrobe.
Otherwise, the moment they enter the room, time will become stuck, and you'll be
unable to use any of your investigative abilities until you leave the room. The
music also becomes pretty *intense*, Boone's mask begins to burn, and the masks
of the people in the room will gain a life of their own and fly toward you. So,
long story short, you don't want to be in the same room as anyone else. That
makes figuring out everyone else's schedules even *more* important, as you'll
need to plan your actions in order to avoid occupied rooms. Of course, nothing's
stopping you from going into an occupied room and just running through it to a
door on the other side. The horrifying music makes that a little undesirable,
but it's an option if you need it. I initially thought there'd be some Game Over
mechanic or something if the flying masks caught you, but there's not, which is
really nice actually.

One of the coolest parts of this game is how the time loop is filled with little
details. The game is split into chapters, and each chapter you'll have to focus
on saving certain people. You're also restricted to certain areas of mansion in
each chapter, so you can't wander too far or get too lost. But despite usually
not being able to go to other areas of the mansion outside the area for the
current chapter, the events happening across the mansion still happen at the
same time each loop. In the tutorial prologue, you'll witness a gunshot during
the first guest's murder, at about 4 o' clock. In future chapters, even when
you're far across the mansion, you'll still hear that gunshot at 4 o' clock.
When I heard it for the first time in the second chapter, I didn't even realize
what it was at first, and it was only later that I realized it was the same
gunshot I'd heard at the beginning of the game, repeating during each iteration
of the time loop!

The game is full of events like that, and another cool thing is that you'll hear and see some things happening around you that you *haven't* witnessed first-hand yet. Things that are important in future chapters are still happening throughout the day. The lights will flicker at specific times, you'll hear weird rattling sounds, something will fall from a tall window down into the garden, and a bell will go off in the evening around 7pm. None of these things will make sense the first time you experience them, but as you get further into the game, you'll come to understand what's causing each of them, and gain a deeper understanding of the events of the day as a whole. All of this made the mansion really feel *alive*, and it was cool to gain that sense of familiarity as you experience the day from different parts of the mansion.

The time loop mechanic also spices up the point and click adventure gameplay.
Usually in these sorts of games, you need to find items and use them in the
right places. But in this game, you not only need the right items but you also
need to be in the right place *at the right time*. In several chapters, there
are some specific windows of opportunity you have where you need to do something
within that timeframe to save a guest, and if you miss it, you won't be able to
save them and will inevitably have to go back in time to try again. That might
sound frustrating, but the game is designed well enough that I was able to
figure out the solutions in each chapter without needing a guide. Your mileage
may vary, of course, but that was my experience with it. It also helps that once
you've seen a character at a specific time, they'll become marked on your map at
that time. Then when you pause the game, you'll be able to pick whatever time of
day you want and see where you've seen people at that time. So, by watching
characters to see which rooms they enter throughout the day, you can get a
clearer picture of everyone's movements, and that's usually pretty helpful in
figuring out what you need to do.

One last note on the gameplay before we move on, The Sexy Brutale takes the
Majora's Mask approach to item collection. When the loop resets, you'll lose all
the items you'd picked up, except for a few key items. You get to keep the
knowledge of any secrets you learned about though, so any secret passages or
passwords you overheard while eavesdropping will still be usable after going
back in time.

The story in this game is fantastic. The mystery of the mansion and the
situation you're in were *incredibly* intriguing to me. I won't spoil anything,
but when I finished the game, I was very satisfied with the story as a whole,
and I think it's one that I'll remember for a long time.

There's so much creativity on display here. At first it seems like a basic
murder mystery, but then the Bloody Girl appears within seconds of starting the
game, and then you're in a Groundhog Day time loop. Everything comes together to
make an incredibly memorable adventure, and I'm so glad I finally played The
Sexy Brutale. I think it's been in my Steam library since December 2017 when it
was part of the Humble Monthly bundle, so it was about time I got around to
playing it. If you're interested in point and click or mystery games, I
definitely recommend this one! My final time was just under 6 hours.
