Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

I finished up Persona Q2 this week, just in time before Fire Emblem: Three
Houses comes out! Which is this Friday, I'm so excited!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Games contained within this post:

 - Animal Crossing: New Leaf *(3DS)*
 - Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth *(3DS)*

### Animal Crossing: New Leaf *(3DS)*

I played the *tiniest* amount of Animal Crossing this week. Only one session of
it, actually! That was just enough time to find out that Cobb was moving out.
Cobb had been in my town from the beginning, so it's a little surprising he's
leaving. I thought some villagers stayed in your town indefinitely...I guess
maybe they do, and Cobb just wasn't one of the lifers!

### Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth *(3DS)*

I finished my playthrough this week! Final time clocked in at just over 40 hours
playing on the easiest difficulty, Safety mode.

As I made my way through the final dungeon, there were some interesting enemies,
called FOEs in the game, that copied my movement. A few simple puzzles were
centered around this mechanic, as you needed to use the FOE to activate a switch
that was otherwise unreachable. When I reached the end of the dungeon, I was
happy to see that it didn't have any irritating gimmicks. For me, that's one of
the nicest improvements from the first Persona Q game; the dungeons are fun to
explore, without the irritating and obtuse puzzles of the first game!

Leading up to the final boss, I had to fight mini-boss versions of each of the
prior 4 dungeon bosses. I was worried about the Sci-Fi boss, since I found its
gimmick annoying the first time around, but luckily this time it had no such
gimmick, and the battle went by pretty quickly! I actually felt like this boss
re-fight mechanic felt pretty natural, and helped make the path to the final
boss more epic.

Without spoiling anything, the final boss was a *lengthy* endeavor, but that may
have just been because my team was under-leveled and/or not properly equipped. I
had to use the Safety mode revival feature 7 times! It was the sort of properly
epic battle you expect from a Persona game, but I'll say no more!

Towards the end, there were a lot of nice animated cutscenes. It seems like the
budget must have been higher for Q2, since I think it had more animated
cutscenes than the first game.

I loved the credits crawl! It featured cute artwork with the credits text
scrolling over it on the top screen, and showed you the maps you'd drawn for
each floor of each dungeon on the bottom screen. I thought this was really cool!
I don't remember the original Q game doing anything similar, but I could be
wrong.

The end of the game was really satisfying. It made the whole experience worth it
for me. You get a nice farewell from each of the characters, then a little scene
plays out for each of the Persona casts in their main hangout spot. It was
great, I loved it! Afterward I had this feeling of closure, but also sort of
missed the characters already. I'm not entirely sure why that is, maybe seeing
the casts hanging out during the end scenes left me nostalgic for their main
Persona games again? Either way, it made it all worth it in the end, even if the
gameplay sometimes did wear on me during the journey!

I'm hoping to get a review out for this one pretty quickly this week, but we'll
see. If I don't write it before Fire Emblem: Three Houses comes out, I'll likely
not get to it for a while!
