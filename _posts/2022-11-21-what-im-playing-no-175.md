### AI: The Somnium Files *(PC)*    {#AI:TheSomniumFiles}

There's a killer on the loose. A killer who removes their victim's left eye
while they're still alive. Detective Kaname Date with the MPD, ABIS division, is
assigned to the case due to his connection to the first victim. With the help of
his AI companion, Aiba, he desperately tries to catch the killer before they
kill again. This is the story of the New Cyclops Killings.

AI: The Somnium Files is a 2019 adventure game developed by Spike Chunsoft and
released for PC, PS4, Switch, and Xbox One. The director and lead writer, Kotaro
Uchikoshi, also wrote for the Zero Escape series, and there's definitely a
similar style and a few similar themes in this game. The flow of the story is
also a little like the Zero Escape series, with a flowchart where you can can
review where you are now in the story, see where it branches into several
different routes, and restart from a previous point.

Gameplay is primarily a visual novel with some point-and-click sections, and the
Psync segments which we'll get into later. You play as Date, and see most of the
game in first-person from his perspective. You can look around during these
segments, but you can't move around the area. During these parts, you look for
clues and talk to people, with the occasional third-person cutscene for the more
action-packed parts. Some of these even have simple quick-time events. The
characters you'll meet during the course of your investigation are an
interesting bunch, but Date and Aiba themselves are just as interesting, if not
more so. Date has a memory disorder and doesn't remember anything past six years
ago. He also lost his eye in an accident around that same time. Aiba was given
to him by ABIS five years ago to be his AI companion, and her body is an
eyeball - which is convenient, since it means she can replace Date's missing
eye. She and Date are linked via an artificial nerve while she's in his eye
socket, allowing him to communicate with her just by thinking. Aiba can also
augment his vision, zooming in, and providing night, thermal, or X-ray vision.
All this advanced technology make Aiba something of a state secret, so Date
isn't allowed to reveal her existence to anyone.

The story here is fantastic. It's many things at many different times: it's
funny, it's suspenseful, it's mysterious. The brand of humor here might not be
for everyone. Some of the jokes are pretty sleazy, but it also relies a lot on
what I'd describe as "goofy" jokes, and sometimes it just gets so absurd that
you can't help but smile. Depending on your actions at several points, you'll
end up on one of several different routes to the game's several endings. Each
route gives you new details and background information, and as you play more
routes these details slowly start to come together for the player. The overall
mystery and the details of each route are interesting in their own right, but
the payoff at the end of the final few routes is just incredible. I had pieced
together some bits of the plot earlier, but I didn't know how they were
possible, and there were still some twists that I hadn't anticipated. The way
everything comes together at the end is extremely satisfying. When you reach the
ending of the first few routes, you'll have *no* idea what's going on, so it's
amazing how other routes add context bit by bit until finally you look back and
know exactly what really happened.

[![wondering what would happen next](https://i.imgur.com/k2ZIzPIm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/k2ZIzPI.jpg)

There were times when I wasn't playing that I found myself wondering what would
happen next, and if there were any clues in anything I'd learned. There's a
character Date calls "Boss," she's his boss at ABIS, and he's called her Boss
for so long he doesn't remember her real name. So, one time when I was somewhere
in the middle of the game, I was heading home from a McDonald's run, and I
suddenly remembered that you learn Boss's real name in one of the routes, and I
couldn't stop wondering if that would be important (it wasn't), but I also
couldn't remember her name! I think it just goes to show how well AI: The
Somnium Files crafts its world and story that I couldn't stop wondering about
random details within it as I went about my everyday life.

In addition to creating Aiba, ABIS also developed the Psync Machine, a device
that allows one person, called the Psyncer, to delve into another person's mind
and explore their memories in a surreal dream world called a Somnium. As the
name of the machine might suggest, this process is called Psyncing, spelled with
a "P." Psyncing is crucial to Date's investigation of the New Cyclops Killer, as
it allows him to learn secrets and find leads that the suspects may be unable or
unwilling to reveal otherwise. The branches in the story always occur during
Psyncs, and most of them have two different outcomes depending on your
decisions.

During a Psync, you explore the subject's Somnium in third-person by controlling
Aiba. This is the only time during gameplay where you can move around the
environment. The goal of the Psync is to make it past several Mental Locks by
exploring the Somnium and interacting with objects around it correctly. The way
forward isn't obvious a lot of the time, there's definitely a lot of trial and
error involved. There's also a 6 minute time limit, and while time stands still
when you're not moving to give you time to think, every action you take when
interacting with an object in the Somnium costs time, sometimes *a lot* of time.
This is where Timies come in. These are expendable resources you can use to
reduce the cost of an action. Some actions in the Somnium give you a Timie, and
using them carefully is key to making it through Somniums. If you use Timies
carefully, you can clear some Somniums on your first try even if you lose a
bunch of time trying to figure out the solution, and sometimes you might clear
them with just seconds to spare. Even if you mess up and run out of time though,
you'll be able to retry from the last Mental Lock. *But* you only get 3 retries
per Somnium attempt, and if you use all of those you have to start over from the
beginning. Luckily, you can fast forward through dialogue and cutscenes, so if
you *do* end up having to replay one of them it's really not bad. The designs of
the Somniums and the actions you can take within them are interesting, some of
them were pretty surreal. The Somnium gameplay itself was fun enough, it adds a
light puzzle element to the gameplay. There's one big drawback to Somniums
that's specific to the PC port, but more on that later.

Listening to this game was wonderful for two reasons. First of all, it has a
great soundtrack composed by Keisuke Ito. I'm not too familiar with his other
work, but as the lead composer on The Somnium Files he's crafted a great
soundtrack. My favorite was probably the music that plays when you're in the
interrogation room trying to get answers out of someone. The English voice cast
for the game is also full of some great, familiar voices. My favorite was Erika
Harlacher-Stone as the voice of Aiba. She also voices Ann in Persona 5 and Kyoko
in Danganronpa, and I'd say her voice for Aiba is somewhere in between those two
characters.

Now it's time to address the worst part about this game, specifically its PC
port: it tends to crash. This is usually during a Psync when you're exploring a
Somnium, but I also had it crash when I was in the options menu once. The
crashes are a common problem on PC, with hit-or-miss solutions available. For
instance, after the first crash I read up on the Steam community page and people
recommended *disabling* Vsync in the game's settings, which confusingly actually
turns on the game's built-in 60 FPS cap, which supposedly makes it more stable.
I also turned the graphics settings down to Normal instead of Fantastic at that
point, and for a while it was fine and ran without crashing. But once I got to
the next Somnium, it crashed again. Following more advice from the Steam
community, I updated my graphics drivers and was able to make it past that
Somnium, but it was far from the last crash I'd experience. After repeated
crashes in a particularly troublesome Somnium, I finally tried turning Vsync on
using Nvidia Control Panel, and turned the game's graphics quality down to Low,
and that *might* have fixed things because I didn't get any crashes afterward. I
didn't feel very confident in its stability given the number of crashes I'd
experienced in Somnium up to that point though, so I continued to save
frequently during these sections as I'd been doing since about the second crash.
It's disappointing that these crashes were never fixed by a patch for the PC
port or something, but it speaks to the quality of the game's story that I and
so many others were willing to struggle through these crashes on PC. The game
has a Very Positive review score on Steam! Given its positive review score on
Steam, you probably wouldn't expect it to have technical issues like this, but
here we are. The last thing I'll say on this is that it's definitely a game
worth playing, but you may want avoid the PC version and play it on another
platform if that's an option for you.

AI: The Somnium Files is a great game, despite its issues on PC. Its story is
definitely worth experiencing, and the music and voice acting are also
highlights. I highly recommend it if you enjoyed the Zero Escape series or if
you enjoy visual novels. My final time was 22 hours 31 minutes.
