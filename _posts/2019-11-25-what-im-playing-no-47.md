Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, spoilers are contained within, especially for the general structure
of the second half of The Banner Saga 3! Generally, I do *try* to keep things
spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to totally
avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a blind
run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### The Banner Saga 3 *(PC)*    {#TheBannerSaga3}

I finished The Banner Saga 3 this week, and the conclusion of the trilogy is
everything I could have hoped for!

I was really taken by surprise when my choices lead to complete chaos breaking
out in Arberrang. I haven't researched to find out if there is any way to avoid
this, but it was really shocking even if it happens regardless of your choices.
Once the chaos breaks out, the game tallies up your choices and you earn so many
days that Arberrang will be spared. Then control shifts back to Iver and his
group.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/swLUIM8.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/swLUIM8m.jpg" alt="Iver and his group"/></a>
</figure>

In a small but amazing move, when control shifts back to Iver's group at this
point, the little day counter at the top of the screen that always counts upward
how many days you have been traveling begins counting *downward*, starting from
the number of Days Spared you earned for Arberrang. The countdown really raised
the stakes. I wasn't sure what would happen when it reached 0. Would Arberrang
be destroyed? Could Iver's group even reverse the darkness in that time? This
part was really well done, it successfully raised the stakes and created a sense
of urgency. Turns out when the countdown reaches 0, things deteriorate further
in Arberrang, and you're put back in control of that group. You fight a battle
there, make a few more choices, and earn the city a few more days.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AIy8huG.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AIy8huGm.jpg" alt="a few more days"/></a>
</figure>

This cycle continues until the end of the game. The last time control shifted to
the people in Arberrang, it was clear that this was their last chance. I don't
know what would have happened if I had run out of days after that point. I'm
guessing everyone there would've died, and the city would have been completely
lost. In the ending I got, a small group survived at Arberrang. After Iver's
group succeeded in eliminating the darkness, those at Arberrang still had their
lives, and hope for the future.

I don't plan on writing a review for this game, but I really enjoyed it. I don't
think it would be a good fit for the spoiler-free review format I like to do
though. If I reviewed this one, I would have to leave a *lot* out to avoid
spoilers. Plus, reviewing it on its own in isolation of the first two games
would be a little awkward too. The whole trilogy definitely has my
recommendation though! The combination of strategy RPG and decision-making
visual novel, plus the unique setting, was a lot of fun for me!

### Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow *(GBA)*    {#Castlevania:AriaofSorrow}

Still riding the hype train I boarded when I played Castlevania: Symphony of the
Night, my journey into the Castlevania series continued this week with one of
the series' GBA entries: Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow.

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2QvEV7L.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2QvEV7Lm.png" alt="Aria of Sorrow"/>

The story follows Soma Cruz, a foreign exchange student in Japan. On the day of
a solar eclipse, he is visiting a shrine. He wakes up in Dracula's Castle with
no recollection of how he got there, and his friend Mina has been brought there
as well. He is greeted by the enigmatic Genya Arikado, who informs him of where
they are, and tells him he can absorb the souls and abilities of the monsters in
the castle. After that, Soma's journey into the castle begins, and the player
takes control of him.

</figure>

Right off the bat, this game is similar to Symphony of the Night in a number of
ways. The doors separating areas of the castle, and how each area has its own
music, are both straight out of Symphony of the Night, and I love it! The
controls and physics feel very similar as well. It also takes place within
Dracula's Castle, but I think that's true of basically every game in the series
so that's no surprise. There are some familiar locations, but the layout is
different from Symphony of the Night, and it feels like a brand new castle to
explore.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

Where Aria of Sorrow differs from Symphony of the Night is with its Soul system.
When defeating an enemy, there's a chance they will drop a Soul that you
automatically absorb. The Souls dropped by enemies are 1 of 3 types: red, blue,
or yellow. Red souls function as a replacement to the subweapons of Symphony of
the Night, and are activated the same way as subweapons in that game, by
pressing Up + B. This is pretty cool actually, since once you collect a red Soul
it's in your inventory permanently. This means if there's a subweapon you
particularly like, or that would be helpful for a boss you're up against, you
can simply go into your menu and equip it whenever you like. These attacks still
consume hearts to use, but the hearts work slightly differently. You have a
hearts meter instead of a count of hearts, and this meter slowly regenerates on
its own, but you can still find heart pickups to increase it faster. Blue souls
are mapped to the R button, and provide various abilities. One blue ability you
find early on is the Winged Armor. This one doesn't come from a monster, but is
just lying around. Required souls have, so far, never come from a monster, and
have always just been found like the Winged Armor. This prevents you from being
entirely at the mercy of RNG to advance, but I'll get into that more later. The
Winged Armor soul decreases your falling speed, allowing you to make farther
jumps to reach new areas. Classic metroidvania progression!

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OGWlII1.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OGWlII1m.png" alt="falling speed"/></a>
</figure>

The last equippable type of soul are the yellow souls, which provide passive
abilities. Some are simple stat increases, while others offer new abilities that
open up new areas to you, like the ability to walk on water. Other than the
souls, there's a small selection of abilities that are similar to the Relics in
Symphony of the Night in that you simply turn them "on" or "off" in your menu
after you acquire them. Things like double jump are in this menu. The majority
of power-ups you find will be in the form of souls though.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NlLuvTv.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NlLuvTvm.png" alt="selection of abilities"/></a>
</figure>

Helpfully, the game also tracks all the types of monsters you've defeated, and
which ones you've gotten the soul of as a drop. Soul drops are pretty rare in my
experience. I don't know if I've ever gotten a soul from defeating an enemy the
first time, it always takes at least a few of them slain before one drops a
soul. The RNG of soul drops hasn't bothered me so far, but if you were trying to
go for 100% soul collection, it would probably get annoying *very* quickly.

As far as enemies and combat go, I've been enjoying it about as much as Symphony
of the Night, but it does seem a little harder. There's more need to dodge enemy
attacks, because some of them really tear into you if you don't. There are some
familiar enemies, but also a number of new enemies. At least, new to me. They
might be in other Castlevania games, but I don't remember seeing them in
Symphony of the Night. I think the combat in Symphony of the Night is better,
partially because you could attack downward instead of simply left and right.
Aria of Sorrow makes up for only allowing attacks to the left or right with its
wide range of red souls, and a wider variety of weapon types. There are basic
swords, but also lances and hammers. Some of the weapons swing in an arc
trajectory, allowing you to hit enemies above you more easily.

My biggest complaint is the bosses are *way* tougher than in Symphony of the
Night. But the worst one was the Death boss. I died to that boss *so many
times*. I would defeat his first form, only to be utterly destroyed by his
second form. The worst part is, if I had potions in my inventory, I'm sure I
could have beaten Death easily. But I was completely out of healing items since
I didn't know such a hard boss was coming. I knew I could go buy healing items
at the store, but that would be a *painfully* long walk back, basically as far
out of my way as possible. Instead, I activated an infinite health cheat, and
finally beat Death. I didn't want to resort to a cheat code to beat him, but I
really didn't want to backtrack all the way back to the store just because I was
out of potions. I turned the infinite health off immediately after beating Death
though.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

The boss after Death was quite challenging as well, but not as much as Death.
For instance, Balore the imprisoned giant dealt a ton of damage with his hits.
My initial approach of just going at him non-stop and swinging my weapon
wouldn't work, because just a few hits from him took Soma down to very low
health. I had to pace myself. Land a few hits, then retreat to safety. Rinse and
repeat, and learn to dodge his other attack patterns, and eventually he was
defeated. It took me several Game Overs to get to that point, but I was proud of
myself for not resorting to the infinite health cheat again.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cz0KN7C.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cz0KN7Cm.png" alt="his other attack patterns"/></a>
</figure>

Defeating Balore gets Soma the Giant Bat soul, which gives him the power to
transform into a bat! Just like in Symphony of the Night, having this ability
opens up a number of new paths and allows you to reach items that you've seen
while exploring but couldn't reach earlier. It costs a lot of heart meter to
sustain the transformation, but it's still probably my favorite upgrade in this
game so far!

</figure>

I think I'm pretty close to the end of the game. I'm looking forward to
finishing it, it's been another solid metroidvania experience so far, and has
really given me a high opinion of the series!
