### Golden Sun: The Lost Age *(GBA)*    {#GoldenSun:TheLostAge}

This week I got the Lemurian Ship, allowing me access to the vast Eastern Sea,
which I could explore freely. Honestly, the freedom was a little overwhelming.
With the expansive ocean of the world map now traversable, I wasn't sure where
to go first. In fact, this part of the game is non-linear, and there are several
dungeons you can explore in any order. I ended up consulting a guide to get my
bearings during this part of the game, and to make sure I didn't miss anything.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lg0irmZ.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lg0irmZm.png" alt="Eastern Sea"/></a>
</figure>

I explored several dungeons including Aqua Rock in order to get the pieces of
the Trident of Ankohl and reassemble it. With the Trident in hand, I was able to
challenge Poseidon at the end of the Sea of Time. After felling the ruler of the
sea, the way to Lemuria was open to me, and we at last reached Piers' legendary
homeland.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FI7zyTU.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FI7zyTUm.png" alt="Lemuria"/></a>
</figure>

The visit to Lemuria included an audience with King Hydros, the Lemurian
monarch. Kraden revealed to the group that he suspects the world itself is
decaying due to Alchemy being sealed away, and King Hydros shares this belief.
With that, the King urged to group continue their quest to light the remaining
Lighthouses, and gave them the Grindstone to aid their quest, which allows the
use of the Grind psynergy and meant we could now reach the Western Sea.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

Eventually, our travels in the Western Sea brought us to the Jupiter Lighthouse.
Before the Lighthouse could be lit, Isaac's group finally caught up with us, but
they were being pummeled by Karst and Agathio, 2 Mars Adepts from the same
village as Saturos and Menardi from the first game. In fact, Karst is Menardi's
sister, and therefore holds a fierce grudge against Isaac. My group stepped in
and prevented Karst and Agathio from killing Isaac and his group. A brief battle
between us occurred after lighting the Lighthouse, but we had no chance of
winning, and it was a scripted battle we were meant to lose. Luckily, the Mars
Adepts fled when Isaac's group came to our aid, having healed themselves from
their earlier battle.

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/aJTXc6x.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aJTXc6xm.png" alt="came to our aid"/></a>
</figure>

Afterward, Isaac's group and my own reconvened at the nearby town of Contigo.
There, Kraden explained why they wanted to see the lighthouses lit, and
convinced Isaac's group to join our own. Now, both parties have joined forces to
see the final Lighthouse lit. Our ship has been given wings by the people of
Contigo, and can now fly over reefs that previously blocked our path. We're
fully equipped for the last leg of the adventure! I'm hoping to finish the game
in the next week, and check the Golden Sun duology off of the backlog!

### Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore *(Switch)*    {#TokyoMirageSessionsFEEncore}

I picked this game up on release day this week! An enhanced port of the original
Wii U game, Tokyo Mirage Sessions was conceived as a crossover of Shin Megami
Tensei and Fire Emblem. The gameplay is way more Shin Megami Tensei than Fire
Emblem, while the story and overall feeling is definitely closer to Persona than
mainline Shin Megami Tensei. Although I still haven't played a mainline Shin
Megami Tensei game, so I'm not speaking from personal experience there.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/C3zXiL2.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/C3zXiL2m.jpg" alt="Tokyo Mirage Sessions"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YBkq6UW.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YBkq6UWm.jpg" alt="Persona"/></a>
</figure>

This is probably the most anime game I've ever played. You play as Japanese high
school student Itsuki Aoi, and the story largely revolves around Japanese Idols.
Itsuki's friend, Tsubasa Oribe, is obsessed with the idol Kiria, and wants to
become an idol herself. Tsubasa's drive partially comes from her tragic past, in
which she was the sole survivor of an incident at a concert 5 years ago where
she watched her sister, who is also an idol, vanish while performing onstage, as
well as the rest of the audience. Hoping to get closer to the truth of what
happened 5 years ago, Tsubasa is determined to enter the idol industry, and
attends an idol competition during the game's prologue.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mcIfezr.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mcIfezrm.jpg" alt="Itsuki Aoi"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KCzwSPQ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KCzwSPQm.jpg" alt="tragic past"/></a>
</figure>

During the competition, disaster strikes again. People grow tired and begin
vanishing as the monsters harvest their "Performa" energy. The MC's appearance
takes a turn for the monstrous as he drags Tsubasa through a portal to a strange
parallel world called an Idolasphere. Itsuki watches in horror, but is quick to
follow them through the portal to try and save Tsubasa. Here you get your first
taste of the dungeon crawling gameplay, as you navigate through a short dungeon
to reach Tsubasa.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/f1aPBzO.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f1aPBzOm.jpg" alt="for the monstrous"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/80MCGQX.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/80MCGQXm.jpg" alt="dungeon crawling gameplay"/></a>
</figure>

Once you catch up to them, Itsuki is nearly overwhelmed by the strange monsters
of this world. Somehow, he manages to bring the monster back to its senses by
shoving a glowing orb of his Performa into it. The monster can them return to
its true form: a being called Chrom. Yeah, like the Fire Emblem character.
Thinking on his feet, Itsuki does the same to the monster that has Tsubasa in
its grip, and it likewise comes to its senses and reveals that its name is
Caeda, another character from the Fire Emblem series.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lJg1rtU.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lJg1rtUm.jpg" alt="shoving a glowing orb of his Performa into it"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/r2oiMdg.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/r2oiMdgm.jpg" alt="Chrom"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6iWaAwd.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6iWaAwdm.jpg" alt="Caeda"/></a>
</figure>

Chrom, Caeda, and the other creatures of the Idolasphere are all called Mirages.
Chrom and Caeda both agree to help Itsuki and Tsubasa fight, transforming into
weapons for them to wield and putting them both through magical transformations
as the two high schoolers assume their Mirage Master forms. Finally equipped
with a way to fight back against the Mirages, Itsuki and Tsubasa fight back
against them, releasing the MC from earlier from Mirage control, and escaping
safely through the portal back to the normal world.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

After escaping the portal, the two meet Maiko Shimazaki. She runs a talent
agency called Fortuna Entertainment. In secret, her agency is really
investigating and combating Mirage-related threats as well, and is in need of
more help on this front. For that reason, she extends an invitation to new
Mirage Masters Itsuki and Tsubasa. They accept, and their entry into the world
of show business and supernatural threats truly begins!

I'm really enjoying this battle system. There are several types of physical
attacks, such as sword and lance, and even more types of elemental attacks like
fire, wind, and ice. The key to victory is exploiting the enemies' weaknesses.
When you hit an enemy's weakness, this can trigger a Session where other members
of your team perform immediate followup attacks for extra damage. Whether or not
they join in the Session depends on their Session Skills.

<figure class="center">
    <div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(70.80% + 44px)'>
        <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/repulsivecircularanaconda' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
</figure>

As you gain mastery with weapons, your characters learn new skills. Some are
Passive upgrades, others are new attack commands, and some are Session Skills.
Session Skills always trigger based on the affinity of the previous attack. For
instance, a skill like Sword-Elec triggers when you exploit an enemy's sword
weakness, and results in an electric followup attack. If another character in
battle has a Session Skill like Elec-Lance, then their followup will trigger as
well. This kind of chaining is really cool! Of course, your enemies can also
perform Session attacks against you, so it's important to be on your guard and
keep your own weaknesses in mind.

</figure>

Despite the gameplay being completely different from that of the Fire Emblem
series, there are a lot of nice nods to Fire Emblem strewn throughout the game.
The sound that plays when a character levels up is the same as in Fire Emblem,
which I love! And of course there's the Mirages that fight alongside the Mirage
Masters that join your party, like Cain and Tharja. I'm really enjoying the nods
to Fire Emblem!

The visual style of the game is executed superbly too. Bright, pastel colored
silhouettes make up the crowds in Shibuya, and give the area a lively feel. I
also love the way the characters helping you on your journey show up in the
menu. It feels so carefree, it's just so cool!

<figure class="half">

</figure>

There's a ton of stuff to do too. The bulk of the gameplay is exploring dungeons
and battling enemies. Enemies drop crafting materials though, feeding into
another large gameplay element: crafting. New weapons are obtained through
crafting, and new skills can be learned through crafting too. There's also side
quests that further develop the characters in your party, and from what I've
seen so far these are definitely entertaining enough to warrant completing!

My only real complaint so far is that there aren't subtitles during battles.
There's no English dub, so I'm reliant on subtitles during cutscenes and the
text in dialogue boxes during events, which I have no problem with at all. But
when the characters and enemies are speaking Japanese during battles, I have no
way of knowing what they're saying because there's no battle subtitles and no
option (that I've found at least) to enable them! Persona Q2 had the same
annoying problem. I'm assuming the voice lines aren't essential, but it would be
nice to be able to understand them, especially since the characters' expressions
sometimes turn fearful or surprised at the beginning of battle when they speak.

Other than that, I'm loving Tokyo Mirage Sessions so far. The music is really
good, I find myself bopping along to it pretty frequently. Battles are great,
and the dungeons have been fun to explore. There have also been 2 full J-Pop
songs so far, and there might be more to come given the emphasis on idols and
whatnot, which is fine by me! So far I've completed the Prologue and Chapter 1,
and I believe I'm pretty close to finishing Chapter 2 now.

### Hollow Knight *(PC)*    {#HollowKnight}

I began the week by fighting a few bosses. The Dung Defender fell to my blade on
my first attempt, but I wasn't so lucky when I stumbled upon the Flukemarm. The
Flukemarm is a completely optional boss, hidden away in an area that might
easily be missed. It's just a big sac hanging from the ceiling of the cavern
that spits out Flukefeys. I died attempting to defeat it at least five times.
After a few attempts, I adjusted my strategy, changed the Charms I had equipped,
and was finally victorious. Defeating the Flukemarm won me a new Charm that I
haven't used yet.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

My travels then took me to the Resting Grounds, an old Hallownest cemetery.
Here, details of the plot and backstory were made slightly clearer, as was my
overall goal. It seems that what the player character has come to do is break
some sort of Seals in order to awaken (or possibly destroy) the Vessel. To break
the seals, 3 beings known as the Dreamers must be awakened, and I think
defeated. A vital part of this will be the Dream Nail, which I acquired in the
world of Dreams after being banished there briefly by the Dreamers' power.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/N7ZQ7VC.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/N7ZQ7VCm.jpg" alt="Dreamers"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/rrAcOrd.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rrAcOrdm.jpg" alt="acquired"/></a>
</figure>

With the Dream Nail in hand, I explored a bit more. I managed to collect a few
more Mask and Soul Vessel pieces, completing a whole of each. These collectibles
are very much like the Heart Pieces of The Legend of Zelda series, and
collecting them is just as fun and rewarding in Hollow Knight. I also found some
Pale Ore and was able to upgrade my weapon again, the small boost in attack
power is definitely welcome as I can defeat more enemies in just 1 or 2 hits.

I ended the week in Crystal Peak. There are interesting laser enemies and bugs
with pickaxes here, mining crystals for some sort of industrial operation. Right
at the end of the week I found the Crystal Heart. It's an awesome super dash
ability! I'm looking forward to seeing which paths are now open to me!
