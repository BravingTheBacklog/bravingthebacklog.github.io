title: Top 10 SNES Games in my Backlog
---

The Super Nintendo is one of the earliest consoles I can remember playing. I was
playing Game Boy around the same time, but as far as my first TV-connected video
game console, it's either Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis. I have tons of fond
memories of playing games like Yoshi's Island, Donkey Kong Country 2, and Super
Mario RPG on the system.

There are still a slew of great SNES games I missed out on though. Some
classics, like Chrono Trigger, I also missed out on, but plan to play on a
different system
([see the Top 10 DS Games in my Backlog]({% post_url 2019-01-29-top-10-ds-games-i-haven-t-played-but-want-to %}) for
details on that!). Others never came out in North America, so essentially didn't
exist for me since I couldn't just go online and read about them. With that in
mind, here's my list of the Top 10 SNES Games in my Backlog!

<!--more-->

## 10. {% include game.html game="ActRaiser" %}

ActRaiser is described as a city-building simulation and platforming game. That
is a very intriguing combination of genres! It sounds like this is accomplished
by having different gameplay segments for each genre, rather than somehow
blending them into a single gameplay phase. Still, it sounds interesting enough
to warrant a try someday!

## 9. {% include game.html game="Fire Emblem Genealogy of the Holy War" %}

The 4th game in the Fire Emblem series, Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War
was released for the Super Famicom, and also came to Nintendo's Virtual Console
on the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS. All of this was exclusive to Japan, however, and the
game still hasn't seen an official English release, though there are fan
translations available.

Genealogy of the Holy War might be responsible for some of the features
that the West wouldn't see until Awakening. Namely, it was the first
game to feature multiple generations of units. You can pair up units,
and they later have a child who will inherit things from their parents.
It's also known for having *extremely* long chapters, and that plays a
part in making me a bit hesitant to start it. Still though, it's a game
I'd like to try someday, and maybe by the time I do there will be a
remake of it on Switch or something!

## 8. {% include game.html game="Breath of Fire" %}

I've heard good things about the Breath of Fire series, at least the first few
entries. Fans of the series would probably prefer to pretend the free-to-play,
microtransaction-filled Breath of Fire 6 never existed. But the series had
strong roots, beginning on the Super Nintendo as a JRPG with some novel ideas.
Like most JRPGs of the time, battles are turn-based and initiated as random
encounters as you explore. Characters in your party can have special abilities
that they use in the overworld to overcome different obstacles, allowing you to
reach new areas for example. Your party members are also all anthropomorphic in
some way, or can transform into an animal form. It sounds like a varied cast of
characters, which is always intriguing.

## 7. {% include game.html game="Shin Megami Tensei if..." %}

An early spinoff of Atlus's Shin Megami Tensei series, "if..." takes the
gameplay of Shin Megami Tensei, but reduces the scope to a single high school
settings. Taking place at the fictitious Karukozaka High School, the plot
follows a player-named high school student after their entire school is drawn
into a demon-filled world called the Expanse. Several of the player character's
classmates are also trapped in the school. Depending on which of these
classmates you side with, there are several paths and endings to the game.

The high school setting was received so well that it played large role in
inspiring another spinoff series a few years later - Persona. As the inspiration
for the Persona series, "Shin Megami Tensei if..." is definitely on my radar. It
received several ports to other platforms over the years, but all of these were
available only in Japanese. It wasn't until 2018 that it received an English fan
translation by Aeon Genesis.

## 6. {% include game.html game="Terranigma" %}

Terranigma is an action RPG for the SNES that follows Ark on his journey to
resurrect the Earth. The game never received an official North American release,
but it did receive and English localization and release in Europe and Australia.
The absence of a North American release is likely due to poor timing. The game
was published by Enix in Japan, but by the time the English localization was
finished for the PAL region, the US Enix subsidiary had been closed.

I'm very curious to try out Terranigma. It's definitely an interesting case due
to its PAL and Japan exclusivity! The action RPG gameplay also sounds pretty
fun!

## 5. {% include game.html game="Secret of Mana" %}

The first game in the Mana series to be labeled as such in the West, Secret of
Mana is actually the 2nd game in the series. The first game, for the original
Game Boy, was just called Final Fantasy Adventure in the West, to capitalize on
Final Fantasy name recognition. Secret of Mana features real-time action battles
instead of the prevalent turn-based system of the time. In it, the player and
their companions fight monsters and more on their quest to save and world, and
re-energize the Mana Sword.

Secret of Mana is available on *so* many platforms. There's even a full 3D
remake from 2018 for PS4, PC, and PSVita. That version has very mixed reviews on
Steam though. I'll likely end up picking up the "Collection of Mana" version on
the Switch. It's a compilation that includes the aforementioned "Final Fantasy
Adventure," Secret of Mana, and the third game in the series (which had never
before been released in English!), Trials of Mana.

## 4. {% include game.html game="Shin Megami Tensei" %}

This game sort of put Atlus on the map. It featured gameplay elements that would
become staples of the Shin Megami Tensei series, such as demon conversation,
recruitment, and fusion. There's also an alignment system for the protagonist,
which ranges from Law to Neutral to Chaos. Their alignment changes based on the
decisions the player makes, and this in turn affects how NPCs and demons will
react to the protagonist.

So, I've listed the original Super Famicom Japanese release date here, because
this game was not localized when originally released. However, it has had ports
to various systems in the decades following its release. One of these systems
was Apple's iOS, and of all the versions that could have been localized, it was
finally the iOS port that was localized and officially released in English for
the first time in 2014. And that iOS release is still the only way to officially
play the original Shin Megami Tensei in English. Though it was also released for
Android in Japan, this version was *not* localized. All this puts me in a bit of
a predicament. I don't have an iPhone, and probably never will, so I don't
really have a way to legitimately play this game. I can buy the iOS version, but
I can't play it on anything! Unless it works on the very outdated iOS version
running on my very old iPod Touch 3...but that seems unlikely. There is a fan
translation for the Super Famicom version though, and some additional fan
patches to remove some irritating aspects of the original release, such as
adding a hotkey to open the map. It's most likely that I'll be emulating the
Super Famicom release with those patches.

## 3. {% include game.html game="Final Fantasy VI" %}

Final Fantasy VI was actually called Final Fantasy III when it first released in
North America, because it was only the third Final Fantasy to be localized. It's
had numerous ports to other systems since then, which all seem to refer to it as
Final Fantasy VI now. On the subject of ports, I'm not entirely sure which
version I'll be playing. There's a PC port available on Steam. This is a port of
the Android version, and both have received a bit of criticism for the changes
made to the sprites and UI. However, there seems to be a collection of mods for
the PC version to make it more faithful to the original SNES release
graphically, so I may give that a try!

Many people are of the opinion that this is the best entry in the Final Fantasy
series. As of this writing, I've only played Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of
Souls, so I don't have much of an opinion on the series myself. Given its
reputation though, I'm certainly looking to experience this one myself!

## 2. {% include game.html game="Lufia II Rise of the Sinistrals" %}

Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals features classic JRPG staples like turn-based
battles and exploration, but also mixes things up by having dungeons with
Zelda-like block puzzles! That sounds like it could be a great combination to
me! Furthermore, although battles are random encounters when exploring the
overworld, enemy sprites appear on the screen during dungeons and combat
initiates when you touch them. I'm delighted to hear this, because I'm not much
of a fan of random encounters. Plus, due to the puzzles present in dungeons, it
makes much more sense not to have random encounters there since it would
interrupt the flow of puzzle solving a lot if it were present.

The story of this game actually serves as a prequel to Lufia 1, also on the
SNES. Since Lufia 2 is a prequel, it's not necessary to have played Lufia 1 to
understand it, but maybe doing to adds to the experience in some way. Either
way, Lufia 2 seems basically universally regarded as the better game between the
two by a wide margin.

## 1. {% include game.html game="Earthbound" checkmark="" %}

**Edit:** Finished, and I loved it! [Check out my spoiler-free review here]({%
post_url 2019-10-19-earthbound-review %})!

An evil alien force has quietly begun to take over the world. People, animals,
and even inanimate objects are suddenly becoming malicious and violent. Only one
hope remains, a young boy from Onett in Eagleland with some psychic abilities.
He is tasked with stopping this evil alien force by a visitor from the future,
who wishes to prevent the dark timeline that it came from.

Earthbound is a huge cult classic, at least outside of Japan. In Japan, it's
actually known as "Mother 2" as it is the sequel to an NES game, "Mother," that
wasn't released in the West (although it would eventual get a Western release on
the Wii U Virtual Console). The tone of Earthbound is often silly and bizarre.
The enemies you fight include taxi cabs and piles of vomit. You get to name the
main character yourself, but I've always referred to him as Ness, because that's
the name he has in the Super Smash Bros. series.

I remember learning about Ness for the first time as a kid when he was the last
character I unlocked on the N64 Super Smash Bros.. I had no idea who he was, but
he had all these cool powers! Fast forward to when Super Smash Bros. Melee came
out, and the intro movie shows him blasting out of a warp hole so fast his shoes
leave a trail of fire on the street in their wake. I'm sure as a kid I came up
with all kinds of stories in my head about Ness and his PSI powers, and even
though I believe he doesn't actually have all of his Smash Bros. powers in
Earthbound, I would still love to see his journey for myself.
