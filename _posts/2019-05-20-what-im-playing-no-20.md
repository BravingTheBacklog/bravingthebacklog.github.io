### Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright *(3DS)*

I finished Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright this week!

On my way to the end of the game, I did a few more Paralogue missions, including
one to recruit Kaden's daughter, Selkie. I didn't use her at all though, Kaden's
stats were better even though both of them were around the same level when
Selkie joined.

More units promoted, Hinata became a Master of Arms, as did his son, Hisame,
shortly after I recruited him. I never used Hisame either, besides in the last 2
chapters when I put him in and always paired him up with Hinata, to boost
Hinata's stats.

The late game chapters see the avatar fighting their Nohrian siblings, similarly
to how Conquest pits you against your Hoshidan siblings towards the end.
Fighting Leo was really easy actually, the small map allowed me to reach and
defeat him very quickly, completing the map in 2 turns. Likewise, the chapter in
which I fought Xander also only took 2 turns!

I lost Scarlet the Wyvern Lord a few chapters before the end. She was the only
wyvern rider I got in Birthright. I had no real attachment to her. She joins as
a promoted class, so I ended up not using her right away because she was
stronger and a higher level than my other units at the time. She ended up
getting neglected. Eventually, a chapter allowed me to have more units than
normal, and I had room to use her. It didn't go very well for her! But like I
said, I wasn't too attached to her, so I just let her fall.

Hinata fell as well during the final battle. He had fallen a bit behind in
levels, so his stats were just dwarfed by the strong enemies in the Endgame
chapter. I was sort of surprised he was the only one to fall, honestly. At least
he got to slay a lot of enemies over the course of my playthrough.

I beefed up my whole team with a bunch of stat boosting items and tonics before
the final battle, so that probably helped give us an edge. This final battle
only took 4 turns, since I knew better than to let the enemy reinforcements keep
coming and overwhelm me. I basically defeated only those enemies that I needed
to in order to reach the final boss as quickly as possible.

Birthright was a lot of fun. Much more laid back than Conquest. Maps were often
just stat-driven numbers games instead of Conquest's strategy-dominated death
marches. I'm not saying Birthright took all the strategy out, but it's
definitely less focused on tactics than Conquest is. Character-wise, it also had
a lot of likeable characters and fun companions. I enjoyed the cast every bit as
much as Conquest. I feel that between the two, I would prefer Conquest,
primarily because the focus of Birthright is the Japanese-like Hoshido nation,
which was a cool twist in a Fire Emblem game, *but* it just didn't feel quite as
much like Fire Emblem as Conquest's ebon-clan Nohrians did.

The story of Birthright fills in some gaps and answers *some* questions I'd had after Conquest, but...all in all, it's still not complete. There's one piece left in the puzzle, and its name is Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation! Onward we go!

### Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation *(3DS)*

Say hello to the last avatar of my first Fire Emblem Fates playthroughs, Corrin!

<figure class="half center">

Upon choosing the Revelation path in Fire Emblem Fates, instead of siding with
Hoshido or Nohr, the avatar chooses to betray neither. However, both sides
decide that the avatar is a traitor then, and you begin this path with the
avatar having made enemies of both sets of their siblings. Only a few allies
stand alongside you initially. Azura and Felicia were Corrin's only allies.

So far, Revelation has had a few unique maps, but mostly reuses maps from
Birthright and Conquest. The new maps are pretty interesting though, some of
them bring back what is almost a Fog of War mechanic. In one, you have to break
through walls of ice, revealing pockets of the map where enemies wait in ambush.
This adds some variety and I found it to be a refreshing change of pace.

### Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! *(Switch)*

Eevee learned the Secret Technique "Sea Skim" this week, which is a replacement
for the Surf HM and allows me and Eevee to travel across bodies of water on a
surfboard.

</figure>

Even though my Eevee and other members of my team had reached the required level
45, I took a detour before I went back to Saffron City's gym. After using the
new Sea Skim ability to reach the Power Plant, I caught a number of
Electric-type Pokémon. Electabuzz, Voltorb, and Magnemite were among those I
encountered and caught.

But, the one I was really there for was Zapdos, one of the 3 legendary bird
Pokémon of Kanto. After wiping out my entire Ultra Ball and Great Ball stock, I
finally caught it after it broke dozens of Poké Balls!

After that detour, it was time for my team to challenge the Saffron City gym.
The inside of the gym looks so cool!

Gym Leader Sabrina's team had me struggling a bit. Their psychic type moves took
down my Victreebel when I tried to use it against her Slowbro, and my Nidoqueen
was defeated equally quickly when I switched it out to use healing items on my
other Pokémon. My strategy for taking them down was alternating between Fearow's
U-Turn and Eevee's Baddy Bad attacks. In the end, the Marsh Badge was mine!

That wraps up my adventures in Kanto this week. I'm sitting at 6 out of 8 badges
collected! Here's a look at my current party. It's not the most balanced, as
Sabrina's Psychic focus did prove difficult, but I like it!
