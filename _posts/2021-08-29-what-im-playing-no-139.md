### Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia *(DS)*    {#Castlevania:OrderofEcclesia}

I finished the game this week, and there are a few things I definitely want to
talk about! First off, this game isn't immune to the curse that plagues so many
metroidvanias: getting the true ending is locked behind a somewhat obscure
requirement. It's not *that* bad in this game, you just have to rescue all the
villagers trapped by Albus scattered throughout the world. *Most* of these are
right in your path or in a side room, and if you explore carefully you'll find
them. But there are 2 that are in *hidden rooms*, the only way to find them is
to either attack every wall you see to check if there's a hidden room behind it,
or use a guide. I used the latter. As far as true ending requirements in
metroidvanias go, this one is pretty straightforward actually, and would be a
piece of cake if not for those 2 hidden villagers.

If you haven't rescued the villagers, you get an automatic game over after
defeating a difficult boss, Albus himself, and the game gives you a hint telling
you to rescue everyone. Having to re-fight the boss is a bit of a slap in the
face, but by that point I'd died to him enough times that I had figured out a
decent strategy. With Albus defeated, it's finally time for the true enemy to
show his head: Dracula.

I wasn't entirely sure Dracula's Castle would be in this game. I mean, it's in
the promotional art, but I thought that might just be a marketing gimmick. I was
*really* glad when it appeared though, because exploring Dracula's Castle is
always super fun, and 2 of the Castlevania games I've played take place entirely
in the Castle so there's definitely some nostalgia there for me. There's also a
really cool looking cutscene that stretches across both screens, with Shanoa
approaching the castle. Such a cool moment! The screenshot really doesn't do it
justice. After that, Shanoa storms Dracula's Castle by herself, and the final
stretch of the game begins!

This was my favorite section of the game, though I do have some complaints which
I'll get to in a minute. It's a pretty good incarnation of Dracula's Castle,
with paths that loop back and allow you to unlock shortcuts, tough enemies, and
more *awesome* music. It also features a tiny bit of non-linear exploration,
because in order to unlock the final area, you have to explore and find the 3
Cerberus glyphs. That part is still *mostly* linear though since you can only
get to them one after the other, but it is possible to miss one if you don't
explore fully and have to come back for it later. So...it's technically
non-linear, I suppose?

That brings me to my biggest complaint, which might actually be a positive for
some players: most of the bosses are *super* challenging at this point. I had
strugged a little with some earlier bosses in the game, but nearly every boss in
Dracula's Castle wiped the floor with me several times before I started to
figure them out, and even after that I still saw many more Game Over screens
before I managed to beat them. I'm not that bothered by this though, because
I've enjoyed games with challenging boss battles in the past, but it's not
something I really expect with Castlevania. I'm used to the bosses looking
impressive, but going down pretty easily, and that wasn't the case for most of
them here!

I also wish there were more utility upgrades. The progression is really driven
by you clearing areas, instead of you finding new power ups which in turn allow
you to reach new areas. That said, there are some cool abilities - the magnet
power is cool, but not used very much. *Very* late in the game you get wings and
can fly around, that was pretty cool!

My complaints end there though. Everything else in Order of Ecclesia was great!
There's a satisfying showdown with Dracula at the end, and yes, he killed me
many, many times. But I prevailed eventually, his castle crumbled away, and the
credits rolled. I love the design of this credits crawl, the background is this
really great minimalist forest at night, with Shanoa's silhouette in the center.
It just looks so good!

Overall, I really enjoyed Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia. Shanoa is probably my
2nd favorite Castlevania protagonist, after Alucard. With this one finished,
there's still 1 more DS Castlevania game I haven't played, and 2 more on GBA.
Maybe someday! My final time was 9:03.
