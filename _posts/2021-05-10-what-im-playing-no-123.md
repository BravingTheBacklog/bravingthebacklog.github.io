Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

I only played The Legend of Hereos: Trails in the Sky last week, and my write up
on it is spoiler-free.

### The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky *(PC)*    {#TheLegendofHeroes:TrailsintheSky}

Like the Trails of Cold Steel series, the Trails in the Sky trilogy is part of
the interconnected Legend of Heroes world. Set in the same world as Trails of
Cold Steel, albeit in a different country, Trails in the Sky follows Estelle
Bright and her adopted brother Joshua as they go on a journey to become
full-fledged Bracers.

Bracers were mentioned in Trails of Cold Steel 1 and 2, and admittedly...I
didn't really get it. My reaction when hearing the term in those games was
something like, "okay, is that supposed to mean something?" Well, had I played
the Trails games in release order, the term would have most certainly carried
more weight, because Trails in the Sky is *all about* Bracers. Estelle and
Joshua become junior Bracers, and the majority of your allies are Bracers as
well, so they're really made out to be the heroes in Trails in the Sky. Fitting,
given that their mission is to maintain peace and order, and help citizens the
world over.

In terms of gameplay, Trails in the Sky and Trails of Cold Steel have a lot in
common. There's a shared core formula here: enter new region, main story
advances, opportunity to do side quests, clear main dungeon, main story
advances, repeat. I have to say though, the side quests feel much more natural
in Trails in the Sky to me, because they're literally jobs from the bulletin
board in the Bracer's Guild, whereas in Trails of Cold Steel they were either
random things people wanted Rean to do or jobs from the Bracer's Guild...but
Rean wasn't a Bracer so...I don't remember why *he* had to do them? I digress.
It's a relaxing cycle, and pretty fun. The side quests are usually "kill this
monster for me" or "get me this item," so I haven't bothered with them unless
the main story is taking to the same area the side quest is in. I don't want to
get *too* sidetracked!

The battle system is also quite similar to what's found in Trails of Cold Steel,
though it is a bit simpler (at least so far). It's turn-based, with battles
taking place on a field you and your enemies can move around in. Some attacks
have an area of effect. It's easy to see how they built upon and improved this
battle system in Trails of Cold Steel, but what's present in Trails of Sky is
quite enjoyable. Simple is not a bad thing!

To give some context to the graphics, this was originally released for PSP
before it was ported to PC. The environment is 3D, but the characters are
pre-rendered 3D models. I think it's a really charming art style, I like the
isometric-ish perspective of it, where you can rotate the camera but not change
the pitch. I also like how the important characters have 2D character portraits
by their dialogue boxes when they're speaking. I wish Trails of Cold Steel did
the same thing, but instead ToCS puts a closeup of the actual 3D character model
there, and I just find the 2D portraits of Trails in the Sky much more
expressive and just better looking.

I've enjoyed what I've played of Trails in the Sky so far. The battle system is
fun, the music is good, the plot and characters are mostly enjoyable when
they're not leaning too deeply into anime tropes. I'm only just beginning to see
the benefits of the oft-touted Trails worldbuilding between the various series
set in this world. For example, the characters sometimes mention the Erebonian
Empire, which is where the Trails of Cold Steel games take place, and it's kind
of neat that I know a bit about Erebonia from playing a few Cold Steel games.
But at the same time, it also makes me dread this series a bit, because there's
*so much*. Trails of Cold Steel 3 seems cool, but I think that a lot of its
story builds upon the characters and events of the Trails in the Sky trilogy and
the Crossbell duology. That's *5 games* that I would need to play just to be
able to know all the characters and events referenced in Trails of Cold Steel 3.
It's intimidating, to say the least! Of course, I wouldn't absolutely *have* to
play all of those games. I could jump straight into Trails of Cold Steel 3, and
just be missing some context and be confused about some things. It wouldn't be
the end of the world. But I don't like to do things that way. All these games
are also *long* JRPGs too, and I don't want to devote all my time to playing
them when there's *so* many other games in my backlog I want to play too. I
think my biggest takeaway is that due to my preference of jumping to different
game series and genres after each game I play, I prefer series that feature
mostly standalone games. Minor references to other games in the series are fine
(like how there are subtle references to Persona 4 scattered throughout Persona
5), but with a series as long-running and lore-deep as Trails, I just don't love
that part of it. I guess that's probably why I'm not really one to watch many TV
shows either. This has been a long tangent, thanks for bearing with me! I plan
on finishing Trails in the Sky, and probably even picking up the 2nd game in the
trilogy eventually, provided I'm still interested when the first game ends
(which I'm sure I will be, Falcom is pretty good at cliffhangers in my
experience). No idea when I'll ever get around to playing other arcs of the
Trails series, but it will probably be years from now!
