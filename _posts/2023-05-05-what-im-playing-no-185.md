### Horizon Forbidden West *(PS5)*    {#HorizonForbiddenWest}

It wasn't that long ago that I played Horizon Zero Dawn. Its sequel, Horizon
Forbidden West released in 2022 for PS4 and PS5. My wife and I picked up a copy
just a few months after launch, and while I didn't play it right away my wife
did. I watched parts of her playthrough, and I remember thinking the story
sounded okay, but not as good as Zero Dawn. After playing the game myself, and
experiencing the story in its entirety, I think I've mostly changed my mind. I
still think Zero Dawn's story is the better of the two, but both games have very
good stories. Zero Dawn tells Aloy's incredible origin story and offers more of
a sense of mystery and discovery in its narrative, while Forbidden West features
more sci-fi elements and sets the stage for the next game in the series nicely.

Many things from Zero Dawn return in Forbidden West, with a few tweaks and
additional polish. Most noticeable right away are the graphical improvements.
Zero Dawn was already a gorgeous game, and Forbidden West somehow manages to
improve the visuals even further. This game is stunning. Many times I had to
just stop and take in the scenery for a while. And this was with the settings
set to performance mode rather than quality, and it still looked beautiful!
Plus, it has a photo mode, which I always enjoy messing around with, and the
photo mode is better than ever, with a bunch of new silly poses to mess around
with.

The Shieldwing is one of my favorite new additions to Aloy's kit, it's awesome.
I loved being able to jump from whatever height I wanted and glide safely back
down to Earth. Another cool new tool is the Pullcaster, which Aloy can use in
mid-air to pull herself to anchor points. On the ground, the Pullcaster serves
another purpose, and lets you pull down fragile structures marked with a
distinctive pattern, and you can also use it to pull around crates that you
can't reach otherwise. The Pullcaster is used in a bunch of puzzles in this
game, and it was a nice addition that added extra variety to those sections.

Aloy isn't limited to exploring just the land anymore, and she can now take to
both the seas and skies too. You can freely dive underwater, and once you unlock
the Diving Mask you don't have to worry about oxygen anymore and can fully
explore the watery depths of the Forbidden West. Underwater gameplay is pretty
limited though, you can't fight machines while swimming so it's limited to
exploring and sneaking. Not being able to defend yourself underwater really
changes things when you see a machine swimming your way though, and it was cool
to have the power dynamic flipped like that.

[![how stunning the game is](https://i.imgur.com/y8QVAxBm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/y8QVAxB.jpg)
{: .image-right }

Very late in the game, you unlock flying mounts, and can override the
pterodactyl-like Sunwing machines and fly around. It's understandable why you
unlock them so late, because being able to fly lets you to skip significant
parts of a lot of stuff around the map, like Tallnecks and Relic Ruins. Flying
was wonderful though, it shows off how stunning the game is from a brand new
perspetive.

Combat has undergone a lot of adjustments in this game. Melee combat is hugely
overhauled, with several different melee combos available to unlock in the
Warrior skill tree. There are also several new elemental statuses including acid
and purgewater, which means a lot of new weapons capable of using ammo types
specific to those elements. There are a number of brand new types of weapons
too, like rapid-firing Boltcasters and armor-piercing Spike Throwers. Weapon
Techniques are another big addition to combat. You unlock these for each type of
weapon by acquiring the associated skills in each skill tree. Using them
requires weapon stamina, which replenishes over time, and these are *very*
useful in battle. Hunter Bows for instance, offer the Arrow Volley skill, where
Aloy quickly shoots several arrows into the sky that rain down on a small area.

Melee Pits offer a place for you to practice the new melee combos, including
challenges that serve as nice tutorials for chaining attacks together
effectively. Each of the Melee Pits includes a challenge battle against the
pitmaster after you've cleared the other challenges, where you'll want to use
what you learned to take them down. Clearing all 3 Melee Pits in the Forbidden
West unlocks the final melee challenge: a battle against a legendary fighter
known as the Enduring, who's trained several of the greatest Tanakth warriors.
The Enduring's identity is played up as a pretty big secret, so I won't spoil it
here, but the battle with them was *awesome*. The rest of the Melee Pits hadn't
been too hard to clear, I cleared most of them on my first or second try I
think, so I went in to the battle with the Enduring assuming it would be just a
*little* tougher, maybe it would take three tries or something. Oh, how wrong I
was! I lost to the Enduring many, many times. On normal difficulty, Aloy can
only withstand about three of their attacks before losing, they deal *so* much
damage. When all was said and done, I think defeating the Enduring took me
something like 30 tries, at least, but I finally did it. That fight really gave
me a new appreciation for the melee combat in this game, the combos you can
chain together feel really fluid and it's a super cool fight.

In Zero Dawn, characters were pretty stiff during dialogue a lot of the time, but here they're much more animated and conversations are more interesting to watch as a result. Once you make it through Utaru territory after roughly the first quarter of the game, you unlock the Base. This is a nice place to chat with Aloy's allies on her journey. They have fun dialogue amongst themselves that you'll overhear when passing through the Base's common area. It's through this dialogue that you learn Erend, one of Aloy's companions and a returning character from the first game, has gained an appreciation for heavy metal after discovering it in the Old One's data. It's a fun little detail, and a really great character moment for him.

[![Machine Strike](https://i.imgur.com/KeDB8Ihm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/KeDB8Ih.jpg)
{: .image-right }

The 10 Commandments of Game Design state that every serious open world video
game series must have some kind of in-game tabletop game. I'm happy to report
that Horizon has cemented its place as a serious open world series by
introducing Machine Strike. I'm pretty bad at it, probably because I got
impatient, never finished playing the tutorial, and jumped straight to harder
opponents. I love that it's in the game though. It's a little tabletop strategy
game where you collect Strike pieces, buying them from shops and carvers, and
each piece is based on a different kind of machine and has its own stats, like
movement range, health, and attack. Then you use your pieces to try and
outmaneuver your opponent and knock out enough of their pieces to win while they
do the same to you. Like I said, I was bad at it, but that didn't stop me from
playing against the lower difficulty players a few times and scraping out a
couple wins.

Gauntlet Runs are basically Horizon Kart. It's a kart racer mini-game, you
collect items, mostly arrows, and you can attack the other racers and use the
arrows you picked up to shoot them. After finishing my playthrough and looking
back on the experience, I thought I enjoyed this mini-game. There's 4 difference
race tracks, and I didn't have any real problems with the first two tracks the
first time I played them. Sure, it was a little stressful trying to win the
race, I felt like I was always mashing some button or another to shoot other
racers with arrows to keep them from pulling too far ahead, or to recover after
getting hit by an arrow myself, but I managed. The final two tracks were a bit
rougher, one because I kept losing and then fell through the ground during one
of my attempts, and the other because I *really* had to focus in order to win,
and it was very nerve-wracking. But still, after all that, I somehow came away
from the experience thinking "that was a fun mini-game." But then, I replayed
the first two tracks on my wife's New Game+ save file to help her get the
achievement for completing them, and it was awful. My mount kept coming to a
complete stop for some reason when I was trying to aim my bow sometimes, leading
to me mashing the run button and shouting at it to move. That experience brought
back the memories I'd repressed from the races in my playthrough, of the times
when I had similar problems with my mount stopping during the races. Gauntlet
Runs are a stressful experience, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.

Just a few weeks after I finished the game, the Burning Shores DLC released
exclusively for the PS5 version of Forbidden West, featuring a new adventure for
Aloy in a brand new explorable area. Having thoroughly enjoyed the Frozen Wilds
DLC for the first game, I was looking forward to this extra content in the
sequel. And...it was alright. The environments are beautiful, with landscapes
that are just as breathtaking as the base game. There's a really cool final boss
battle. It's quite a setpiece, I think it makes for a better final boss than
what the base game had, it's definitely much more of a spectacle during the
battle itself. There's also a Jurassic Park type region added in the DLC. The
T-Rex statue has to be an homage to the visitor's center scene at the end of
Jurassic Park, you can't convince me it's not. But other than that, Burning
Shores was just alright. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy my time playing it, but
it seems a bit light on content compared to Frozen Wilds. I also didn't
particularly like main new character it introduced, Seyka. I think you're
supposed to like her, she accompanies Aloy on all the main quests in Burning
Shores, but she just didn't click with me. It feels like they were trying *too*
hard with her, I guess? It doesn't help that you really don't have much time to
get to know her, because there's not very many main quests in the DLC.

Purchasing the DLC does unlock some cool new abilities for Aloy that you can use
both in the new area and in the base game. There's a couple new skills added to
the existing skill trees, but the coolest new addition was the Grapple Strike.
This lets you use the Pullcaster to hookshot yourself toward a downed enemy and
give them a good stab. It's fun to use, cool to see, and it does a bunch of
damage, so it's a win-win all around.

Here's a fun fact about Burning Shores: the main villain is played by Sam
Witwer, who also played the main character in Days Gone, Deacon St. John. I
guess I'm a fake Days Gone fan, because I didn't recognize him at all on my own,
and instead found out thanks to a Reddit thread on the Horizon subreddit. I
couldn't stop seeing his character in Horizon as Deacon St. John afterward, even
though they're nothing alike besides sharing Sam's likeness and voice.

Horizon Forbidden West is a real gem of an open world game. It's a blast to play
through, and also paves the way for Aloy's next adventure in Horizon's
machine-riddled world. I'd easily recommend it to anyone who enjoys open-world
action RPGs, especially if you already played the first game. Burning Shores
isn't such an easy sell for me. It was fun, but I don't think it adds any new
must-play content to the game. Whether or not you should buy it depends on much
of a Horizon diehard fan you are, I guess. My final time for Horizon Forbidden
West was 49 hours 36 minutes, and Burning Shores added add additional 7 hours 14
minutes on top of that, for a total final time of 56 hours 47 minutes.
