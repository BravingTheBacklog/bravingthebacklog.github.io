Fire Emblem Fates is a unique entry in the Fire Emblem series, as it is
available in three versions. Each version is basically a standalone game with a
unique plot and different allied units, and offers a different perspective on
the plot and characters.

To get the most out of it, you'll want to play all three versions. That's
exactly what I did! Here are my thoughts on the Fire Emblem Fates games in
this spoiler-free review.

<!--more-->

The premise of the plot is that two kingdoms, Nohr, and Hoshido, are at war.
Nohr is on the verge of invading Hoshido. Hoshido prepares to defend itself from
the impending attack. Caught in the middle of this conflict is the avatar, whom
the player can name and customize when starting a new game.

Fire Emblem Fates is known as "Fire Emblem if..." in Japan, and I assume that's
because each version of Fates is essentially a different "what if...?" scenario.
Each game follows the player created avatar after they make a critical decision
at Chapter 6. The story up through Chapter 6 is the same across all three
versions, but afterward the plot and allies differ greatly depending on the
avatar's choice.

</figure>

Well, I guess player has probably already made their choice by that point,
because each path the player can choose is one of the three versions of Fates,
each of which is sold separately. Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest and Fire Emblem
Fates: Birthright are both available as physical copies, while Fire Emblem
Fates: Revelation is only available as DLC. Conquest and Birthright are US$39.99
MSRP, however you can purchase the other version at the discounted price of
US$19.99 as DLC on the eShop once you own one version. Revelation is US$19.99.
So if you're a newcomer to Fire Emblem and you're not planning on spending
US$59.99 to buy two versions right away, your path is picked for you just based
on the initial version you buy.

### Review structure

Since Fire Emblem Fates is composed of three different games, I'll be doing a
"mini-review" of each of the versions, in the order I played them. Overall
thoughts on the Fire Emblem Fates experience and gameplay as a whole will be at
the end.

Each of my playthroughs was done in Classic Mode on Normal difficulty. Similarly
to Fire Emblem: Awakening, each version of Fates allows you play in Casual,
Classic, or the new Phoenix mode. In Casual mode, fallen units are not gone
forever, and return upon completion of the level. Classic mode stays true to
Fire Emblem's roots, and units who fall in battle are gone forever in that
playthrough. Phoenix is a new mode wherein units that fall in battle are
returned at full HP at the start of your next turn.

These game modes exist separately from the difficulty level. The player can
choose between Normal, Hard, and Lunatic difficulties when starting a New Game.
For the first time in a Fire Emblem title released outside of Japan, the
difficulty level can be lowered during a playthrough between chapters. This
seems pretty nice actually. I couldn't use this feature since I was already
playing on the easiest difficulty, but I can see it being useful for someone who
maybe started Conquest on Hard or Lunatic mode and began to regret their choice
a few chapters in.

Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest centers on the kingdom of Nohr. The focal point here
is Nohr's conquest of Hoshido.

{: .image-right }

Of the three Fates games, Conquest is undoubtedly the most difficult by a wide
margin, especially compared to Birthright. There are a few reasons for this.
Conquest doesn't allow you to grind for experience, levels, or items. The only
battles you will face are the main story Chapters, Paralogue missions unlocked
when two units form an S rank support, and a small fixed number of Invasion
missions that become available periodically throughout the game. Because of
these factors, experience, gold, and items are limited. Aside from this, it felt
to me like the odds were against the player in many of the chapters. Enemies
were powerful, plentiful, and smart, so careful use of map and terrain features
was absolutely essential in order to secure victory.

In fact, I'd say that of the Fire Emblem games I've played, Conquest was
probably the most difficult of all of them when playing Classic mode on Normal
difficulty. The only other Fire Emblem that I can remember being anywhere near
as difficult as Conquest is probably Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn. I remember
struggling really hard to keep my units alive toward the end of that game.

The characters the avatar fights alongside in Conquest are probably my favorite
cast of the 3 Fates games. There's a caveat there in that many of these
characters are also present in Revelation, but we'll get there later. The
Nohrian royal family in particular I preferred over the opposing Hoshidan royal
family of Birthright. This is entirely personal preference of course. Overall, I
think the aesthetic of Nohr and their black armor was just really *cool*.
Conquest's story is also more grim than either of the other two games. I don't
want to spoil anything though, so I won't say more than that.

Another thing I liked about Conquest is that it primarily features the
traditional Fire Emblem classes that I'm used to. Nohr's soldiers are Fighters,
Knights, Mercenaries, Cavaliers, and other typical Fire Emblem classes. This is
in contrast to Birthright, but I'll cover that shortly.

One of Conquest's biggest shortcomings was the final boss in the final chapter.
Strategically, the map and boss were excellent, and forced you to consider moves
and plan your strategy carefully. But in the context of the story, the boss felt
very underwhelming. After I played Birthright and Revelation, this was only
furthered solidified as both of those had better final bosses.

Birthright is the easiest version of Fire Emblem Fates, but this isn't a bad
thing. Unlike Conquest, the odds don't seem strongly against you during the
Chapters. The lower difficulty makes it very approachable for newer or more
casual players. Anyone looking for a less intense experience will also enjoy the
experience. For me, playing Birthright after playing Conquest was a nice,
relaxing change!

Birthright's story follows the Hoshidans as they fight against invaders from
Nohr trying to take their country. It feels like you're playing as the good guys
here. This is basically the opposite of how Conquest feels. Birthright isn't all
fun and games though, there are heart-wrenching moments from time to time too.

Hoshido draws a lot of inspiration from Japan. The units you recruit are special
Hoshidan classes, like Samurai, Diviner, Ninja, and more. It took me a while to
get used to these. Samurai are equivalent to Myrmidon in past games, Diviners
are Mages, and Ninjas are Thieves. Eventually I got used to the Hoshidan
classes.

Not all of them are simply renames of previous games' classes. Kinshi Knights, a
promoted option for Sky Knights and Archers, are unique in that they are mounted
flying units that can wield bows and lances. They're the first type of unit in
Fire Emblem that can fly and use bows.

Birthright also allows grinding if you want to. By playing the "Challenge"
missions available between main story Chapters and Paralogue missions, you can
gain extra experience and levels for your units. These are essentially
unlimited, since if you run out of available Challenge missions you can use the
"Scout" option to spawn a new one for a small amount of gold. The cost is so low
that it would take a *long* time to spend all your gold Scouting.

I didn't grind *too* much in Birthright, but I did occasionally like to use
Challenges to build up a Support between units. I was able to get many more S
rank supports in Birthright than I was in Conquest. Birthright really lets you
focus on your characters' Supports if you want to, which was nice.

</figure>

Revelation had the best story of the three, in my opinion. At the end, I finally
had closure of all the loose ends left in Conquest and Birthright. In addition,
Revelation has a nice, feel good type of ending that a lot of JRPGs have, and
it's quite satisfying.

Revelation also lets you to have units from both Conquest and Birthright in your
army, allowing you to build up supports between Hoshidan and Nohrian units.
After playing both Conquest and Birthright prior to it, this was really cool to
see! You can basically pick your favorite units from both Conquest and
Birthright and form a Fire Emblem Fates dream team, which was pretty awesome.

As for the gameplay, Revelation is more difficult than Birthright. Its maps have
more gimmicks than Birthright's, and utilizing these whenever possible is
advised in order to make it through with your units unscathed. Conquest is still
*far* more difficult than Revelation though. Like Birthright, Revelation allows
you to grind using Challenge missions if you so choose. This can keep the
difficulty down, and I did a little grinding myself.

### Overall thoughts

[![](https://i.imgur.com/XDQ7tF0m.png)](https://i.imgur.com/XDQ7tF0.png)
{: .image-right }

Story-wise, playing only one of Fates versions would be pretty unsatisfying. If
the only game you play is Conquest or Birthright, you'll be left with some
hanging threads, and you won't understand certain aspects of the plot because
you need to play the opposite version to fully understand certain character
motivations and backstories. And even though it has the most complete story on
its own, no one is going to play *only* Revelation because you need to own at
least 1 of the other games in order to play it! Plus, I imagine starting with
Revelation wouldn't the same if you didn't know the characters well from playing
Conquest and/or Birthright beforehand. There's even an in-game warning to this
effect when starting a Revelation playthrough.

That said, the story is good, if largely predictable. It does still throw some
curveballs on occasion. The full story you get from playing all three versions
feels very complete and fleshed out. The big picture is definitely worth seeing
for yourself. There are certain bits toward the end of Revelation that seem like
they *might* have plot holes, but it's enjoyable in any case.

#### Maps & Re-use

Compared to Awakening, I feel like Fates has more varied victory conditions.
Awakening seemed to be Rout Enemy the majority of the time. The Fates games have
their fair share of Rout Enemy maps, but also make use of Seize, and even maps
where you have to have all your units Escape to win. Changing the victory
condition to something other than Rout Enemy keeps things feeling fresh, and I
definitely appreciated this in Fates compared to my memories of Awakening.
Sometimes even when the victory condition is Defeat Boss, there are still unique
aspects to certain missions!

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XblGLXf.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XblGLXfm.png"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/p939hSA.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/p939hSAm.png"/></a>
</figure>

The Fates games do re-use certain maps though. Story-wise, I have to admit it
does make sense to do so. Between all 3 versions, the plot does have you visit
some of the same locales, so it makes sense those areas would have the same
layout between versions. I believe the enemy layouts and victory conditions
differ between versions even for the same location. But, after playing through
all 3 versions, some of the re-used maps did end up feeling a little stale by
the end. During the majority of Revelation, I was seeing re-used maps from
Conquest and Birthright more often than unique maps.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/nUUr84wm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/nUUr84w.png)
{: .image-right }

Another case or reuse, or perhaps repurposing in this case, occurs with some of
Fates' characters. Those who have played Awakening may recognize some familiar
faces among some of Fates' characters. For whatever reason, some characters in
Fates are just re-skins of characters from Awakening. Take Awakening's Tharja
for example. In Fates, Rhajat is basically the same character, right down to her
affinity for dark magic and curses. Some of these apparently are explained via
Support conversations, but others are just unexplained recycling. It's not
really a problem, but it does feel a bit cheap to have some of the same
characters brought in from Awakening with slightly updated designs and changed
names.

#### S Supports and Children

Child characters are present in these games, and work similarly to Awakening.
Characters may have only one S rank Support. When they reach S rank, they become
romantically involved and have a child who you can recruit to join your army by
playing the newly unlocked Paralogue mission. I enjoy the existence of child
characters, as they're a nice reward for reaching S rank with two units.
However, these children are mostly young adults when they join, and the story
explanation for how this is possible is *very* weak in Fates. The story
explanation for them definitely was more solid in Awakening. But if you can get
past that, they again make for a nice gameplay mechanic.

</figure>

#### Weapons triangle & Pair Ups

The weapons triangle has been adjusted in Fates. The relationship between
Swords, Axes, and Lances remains the same, but a second class of weapons has
been added to each grouping. Now, Swords and Tomes have an advantage against
Axes and Bows. Axes and Bows have an advantage against Lances and Hidden Weapons
(knives, shurikens). This new weapons triangle makes things feel different
enough for a series veteran that it does keep you on your toes.

</figure>

[![](https://i.imgur.com/FSHHQMFm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/FSHHQMF.png)
{: .image-right }

The Pair Up mechanic from Awakening returns here, allowing two units to be
Paired Up and stacked on a single tile, with the front unit fighting in combat
and the Paired Up unit providing stat bonuses to them. This system has had a few
tweaks, most notably the "Dual Guard" mechanic. This allows the backup unit can
block all incoming damage during battle if the pair's shield meter is full. Each
time a unit enters combat, their meter charges up a bit if they're Paired Up
with another unit. Once it's full, the next time an enemy attacks them their
partner will Guard them against all damage. This was very cool and added another
level of strategy, as you could attack enemies with high crit weapons without
worrying about a critical hit taking you out.

This Guard system also applies to enemies, which is really cool to see!

#### My Castle

In place of Awakening's Barracks feature, Fates introduces "My Castle." This was
an interesting feature, although I didn't explore any of the StreetPass or
Internet features I think it had. Between missions, you have access to a castle
that you can name and walk around in. The other units in your army appear here
as well, and will occasionally have random events available where they give you
an item or receive a temporary skill boost if you talk to them. You're able to
build and upgrade buildings on your castle grounds as well, placing buildings
that allow you to buy weapons, or buy staves, or combine weapons together to
increase their strength. You can even zoom in to see your units and buildings up
closer, and pivot the camera around the avatar.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4FEvgqJ.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4FEvgqJm.png"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/rtReqt4.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rtReqt4m.png"/></a>
</figure>

I feel like the single-player My Castle feature has a lot of room for potential
expansion. It'll be interesting to see if they expand upon it in future Fire
Emblem games.

#### World Map

Awakening's World Map was way better than Fates' in my opinion. Fates' World Map
didn't allow you to scroll around it freely. Instead, you pick the mission to do
next from a menu, scrolling to the location on the map where the mission takes
place. Because of this, I had a much shallower understanding of the geography in
this world. If Fire Emblem is going to allow me to tackle Paralogue or Challenge
missions at my leisure between Chapters, they might as well let me walk around a
world map, like in Awakening, and in The Sacred Stones.

#### Final verdict

If you've never played a Fire Emblem game before but want to get into the series
and own a 3DS, I'd probably recommend Awakening over Fates. On the off chance
that the series doesn't work for you, at least you get a complete single game
experience out of Awakening, and you also don't the lingering "what if I don't
like this because I picked the wrong version?" question you might have if you
started with Fates' Conquest or Birthright.

Overall though, all three versions of Fire Emblem Fates are solid entries in the
Fire Emblem franchise, and I definitely recommend them. They bring RPG and
strategy together just as the rest of the series does, and they do so while
telling a compelling story in a fantasy world wracked by war, filled with a cast
of characters with interesting personalities. And that's what Fire Emblem is all
about.
