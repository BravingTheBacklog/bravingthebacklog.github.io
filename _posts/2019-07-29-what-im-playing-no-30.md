Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

I actually kept things completely spoiler-free this time around. Partially
because covering everything going on in the plot for Fire Emblem: Three Houses
would take a while, and I don't want to write a novel here! Games contained
within this post:

 - Animal Crossing: New Leaf *(3DS)*
 - Fire Emblem: Three Houses *(Switch)*

### Animal Crossing: New Leaf *(3DS)*

I decided to use some of my saved up bells to pay off my loan at the start of
the week. Immediately afterward, I went over to Nook's and asked him to expand
my second floor. He obliged, completed the work overnight, and saddled me with
another debt to repay. He calls it pocket change, and he's not *too* far off,
but I want to save up a bit more money before I pay this one off. My second
floor is now a little bigger and I don't really know what to do with the extra
space yet.

A new villager moved in, he's Vic, a bull villager! Honestly the only time I
talked to him was when he was unpacking. Then I forgot he had moved in for the
rest of the week.

### Fire Emblem: Three Houses *(Switch)*

Fire Emblem: Three Houses came out this week, and it was a Day One pickup for
me!

Booting it up for the first time and hearing the main menu music already had me
looking forward to the experience. The main menu music is the main Fire Emblem
theme, but it's given a somber feeling by having it played on a pipe organ. As
with the last few entries in the series, you can choose to play without
permadeath with Casual mode, or with permadeath with Classic mode. In keeping
with my tradition, I've chosen Classic mode on Normal difficulty for my first
playthrough.

You get a choice between playing as a male or female character, and you also get
to name them. Byleth is the default name, and I almost went with that, until I
remembered my tradition of naming my characters Worm and went with that!

Right off the bat, your mercenary life with your dad, Jeralt, is interrupted by
a group of kids looking for your help fighting bandits, and the first battle
begins! The battle UI looks really nice, and the combat forecast is easy to read
and contains a lot of helpful information.

After the bandits have been dealt with, you learn the kids are students at
Garreg Mach Monastery, one thing leads to another, and BAM you're hired to be a
professor there! That is an extreme simplification of how things play out, but I
don't want to get into story details too much. I'm finding the setting and story
very enjoyable though, for what it's worth! I just don't think I can really do
it much justice writing about it. Basically, you pick one of the Three Houses to
teach, and that has a big impact on your playthrough I presume. At the very
least, it controls the units you'll have under your control for quite some time.
I picked the Black Eagles because I thought Edelgard was a really cool
character, which has proven to be true. Dorothea and Petra also seemed like cute
characters, they've both proven to be valuable units on the battlefield too.

Although, PatronusLight and I both agreed that Mercedes is probably best girl.
But she's in another house, the Blue Lions, and was basically the only character
in that house we liked. It should be possible to Recruit her to join the Black
Eagles at some point though. We just need higher magic and bow skills in the
Black Eagles, I think, which I've been trying to work towards.

The strategic combat is present in full force, with some tweaks and
improvements. One thing I've come to absolutely love is the feature that shows
you which units your enemies will target. This is shown with arcing red lines
connecting enemies with their intended target, and it even shows you an estimate
of how much damage that enemy will do. This is such a nice improvement, I've
really enjoyed this so far!

[![Weapon durability](https://i.imgur.com/fcezzI5m.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/fcezzI5.jpg)

Weapon durability is back, which I am really happy to see! It's just something
I've come to expect from Fire Emblem. Now there's also the ability to easily
repair weapons by visiting the blacksmith and spending a few gold and resources
though, no rare Hammerne staff required!

Combat Arts have returned after being introduced in Shadows of Valentia, but now
instead of costing HP they use extra weapon durability. They also seem more
common, as many characters start out knowing at least one Combat Art, and learn
them by leveling up their weapon skills. Both of those factors make Combat Arts
more practical, and I've been using them more than I did in Shadows of Valentia.

It's also really cool to see the battle animations. Since the Switch is
significantly more powerful than the 3DS, the different is huge. They're like
the battle animations from Path or Radiance or Radiant Dawn, but in HD and
probably better.

The last big difference I want to cover is Monastery exploration. During these,
you roam freely around the Monastery, talking to students, accepting optional
quests, and completing main story quests. I see this as an evolution of sorts of
the My Castle feature from Fates. Reaching outside of the Fire Emblem series,
it's basically identical to the sections in The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold
Steel where you explore the town and school between monthly missions. I like it
a lot, and I've spent a lot of time interacting with students and completing all
the optional quests so far. Probably more time than I've spent in combat, to be
honest, but it's nice the game allows for player choice and you could spend much
less time exploring the Monastery than I have, if you didn't care for that part
of the game.

Honestly, there's so much to do and so many mechanics in Three Houses, it would
take me a long time to cover them all! I'll probably devote more time to that
after I finish my playthrough, and maybe even a second playthrough, and write a
review on it. But for now, hopefully this was a decent taste of what Three
Houses is like. It's a fantastic experience so far, and I'm looking forward to
playing a *lot* more of it in the coming weeks!
