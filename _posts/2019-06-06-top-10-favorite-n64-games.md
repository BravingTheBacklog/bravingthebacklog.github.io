title: Top 10 Favorite N64 Games
---

The Nintendo 64 was the first console I played to have full 3D graphics. I was
really young during the N64's heyday, therefore I hadn't played a lot of video
games yet. So seeing video games in 3D for the first time probably wasn't as
revolutionary as it was to someone who'd played a lot of NES or older systems.
But I still have some great memories of the games the N64 has to offer!

N64 aficionados will no doubt see an enormous omission from this list: Super
Mario 64 isn't on it! This is because I never had Super Mario 64. My time
playing it was *very* limited, as I could only play it when we rented it from
the video store, which probably only happened a few times. Of course, my save
file wasn't guaranteed to be kept between rental periods, so each time I would
have had to start over. Those factors mean I missed out on the groundbreaking
experience of Super Mario 64 when it initially released, and now it's probably
too late for me to go back to it now that I've played more recent Mario games,
like Sunshine and Galaxy.

## 10.  {% include game.html game="Star Fox 64" %}

We never owned Star Fox 64, but we rented it from the video store a few times.
It was basically the perfect game to rent. A single playthrough is meant to take
only a short time, and there are multiple paths through the game.

The gameplay is a lot of fun, you control Fox as he pilots a few different
vehicles, but its primarily his Arwing that you control. Flying through space
shooting down evil robots and henchmen of the evil Andross is a great time! And
of course, Star Fox 64 is legendary for giving such memorable quotes as "Do a
barrel roll!"

## 9.  {% include game.html game="Pokémon Snap" %}

Pokémon Snap is an interesting game. You play through on-rails levels in
first-person as your auto-piloted vehicles takes you through scenic vistas where
you see various species of Pokémon. Your goal is to take pictures of these
Pokémon for Professor Oak. In addition, you have apples and "pester balls" that
you can throw at Pokémon to interact with them. This is the only way to get
certain species to show up, whether it be due to triggering a Pokémon evolution
or just luring out an elusive species!

This game is fun, if not all that re-playable. Once you know what to do to get
photos of all the species, it probably doesn't take long to beat.

## 8.  {% include game.html game="Donkey Kong 64" %}

As a kid, I enjoyed Donkey Kong 64 a lot. I played this before I ever played
Rare's Banjo Kazooie titles, but they all share the same formula. You navigate
through levels collecting a bunch of things, and gradually gain new powers to
enable you to collect more things. By collecting more things, you gain access to
new worlds, with more things to collect.

These days, Donkey Kong 64 generally appears to be considered inferior to Rare's
Banjo Kazooie games. Personally, since I haven't played through Banjo Kazooie or
its sequel Banjo Tooie, Donkey Kong 64 reigns supreme among Rare's
collect-a-thons.

## 7.  {% include game.html game="Mario Kart 64" %}

Battle mode in Mario Kart 64 was the best of the series, at least of those that
I've played. Compared to Super Mario Kart, it innovated a *ton*, and kickstarted
the Mario Kart series, in my opinion.

That's all I really have to say about this one. You control Mario and other
Mushroom Kingdom inhabitants and drive around in karts. It's fun!

## 6.  {% include game.html game="Super Smash Bros." %}

The game that launched an incredibly successful fighting game series: Super
Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64. When my family got this game, I don't think any
of us knew what it was all about. My parents saw Mario and Pikachu on the cover,
and they probably though, "Hey, it's the kids' favorite characters, let's get
this for them." The rest is history.

Beyond introducing me to what turned out to be a really fun game to play with
family and friends, Smash Bros. also introduced me to brand new characters. I'd
never heard of Ness or Captain Falcon before playing this game. When I unlocked
Ness for the first time, I thought he was the coolest character ever. A kid with
PSI abilities and a baseball bat? Awesome!

## 5.  {% include game.html game="Pokémon Puzzle League" %}

In a rare twist, this is a Pokémon spin-off game that never released in Japan. It
only came out in North American and Europe! It's part of the Puzzle League, or
Panel de Pon, series, which all share similar puzzle gameplay. Pokémon Puzzle
League just puts a Pokémon theme on top of it.

Played a lot of this on the N64 as a kid. The mechanics were *so* fun. You swap
two tiles and try to make chains 3 tiles or longer. The longer the chain, the
more obstructions you add to your opponent's play area in versus modes like the
campaign. I always wanted to beat the campaign mode on the hardest difficulty,
but the final battle against Mewtwo was way too hard for me!

## 4.  {% include game.html game="Kirby 64 The Crystal Shards" %}

Kirby games are always fun, and Kirby 64 is no exception. With its early 3D
graphics, it's not as visually charming as Kirby's other adventures, but it
still has a decent amount of cuteness. One interesting feature Kirby 64 brings
to the table is the option to combine copy abilities to form new ones. So for
example, you could combine the Fire ability with the Bomb ability to create the
Fireworks power. So while there are only 7 different base copy abilities, since
they can all be combined with themselves and one another, there are quite a few
possible powers.

Another fun element in Kirby 64 were the Enemy Cards you could collect. At the
end of each stage there's a mini-game where you jump to get a reward, and one of
these is usually a random Enemy Card. Once you collect them, they show up in the
Enemy Book, and I always wanted to collect them all. I don't think I ever did
though.

## 3.  {% include game.html game="Mischief Makers" %}

Mischief Makers is a 2D side-scrolling platformer starring Marina, the
Ultra-InterGalactic-Cybot G. Marina's long-winded, over the top title gives you
an idea of the mood of the game: whimsical, and ridiculous. Marina's creator,
Professor Theo, is kidnapped by brainwashed cronies of The Emperor, and Marina
is the only one who can rescue him!

I have no idea what drew me to this game as a kid, but I am so glad I convinced
my parents to buy it for me. It's criminal that Mischief Makers has never had a
re-release. There's a really charming story here too! I'd definitely recommend
Mischief Makers to anyone looking for a new N64 game to try.

## 2.  {% include game.html game="The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time" %}
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is often heralded as a classic.
One of the greatest games of all time. Critics will say that this is
nostalgia, and I can't rule that out since Ocarina of Time was a big
part of my childhood. However, I still enjoy Ocarina of Time a lot
today, and as a kid it was such an eye-opening experience. Before
leaving Kokiri Forest, I was introduced to a world with fairies, and
the mythos of the 3 goddesses who created this fantasy world of
Hyrule. This was only the beginning the adventure, and it was a great
beginning to what would be an incredible adventure. It remains near
and dear to my heart to this day.

## 1.  {% include game.html game="Paper Mario" %}

Like the title of the game indicates, Mario is made of paper this time! In fact,
everyone in Mushroom Kingdom is. It's not some curse of anything, it's just the
way things are in this game. Probably because the entire game is basically
happening inside a storybook. Paper Mario is the spiritual successor to Super
Mario RPG on the SNES, another great game, in that you fight turn-based battles,
explore, level up, gain new party members, and play as Mario. Everything you
could ever want in a Mario RPG!

This is my favorite N64 game. I find that it holds up incredibly well today,
both gameplay-wise and graphically. Unlike many of its contemporaries, Paper
Mario avoids the now dated-looking polygonal characters by having a cast made of
paper, and represented in game via 2D sprites. The game is just so fun and
charming too!
