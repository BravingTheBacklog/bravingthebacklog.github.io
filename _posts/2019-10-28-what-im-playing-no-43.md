Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Games contained within this post:

### Valkyria Chronicles *(PC)*

I played a *bunch* of Valkyria Chronicles this week, and it was awesome. I'm
really into it now. I'm finally grasping the finer points of combat and
strategy, and the story has picked up a ton too!

I love that the writing and story humanize both sides of the conflict. The
soldiers of the Empire aren't evil, they have families and are fighting for
their country just like the Gallians are. Even an enemy general, Gregor, is
humanized in this way. Of course, Gregor still isn't a great person. He's later
shown treating people in an Imperial concentration camp quite poorly.

I struggled with one mission pretty hard, getting several Game Overs. In the
end, I wound up looking up a guide online, trying to get an idea of what I was
doing wrong...and I realized I was hugely misunderstanding one of the unique
mechanics of the level. The goal was to take down an armored APC using only
rifles (no explosive weaponry allowed), before it reached the other end of the
map. What I didn't realize is that it's path around the stage was not
pre-determined, but could be influenced by moving your tank to block its path
and direct it where you wanted. The part I didn't grasp is that you can tell
which direction it will move on the next turn by which way the headlights are
pointing. That...was not something I noticed, but it made a huge difference once
I realized this since I could see where it would move next, and better use my
own tank to direct it where I wanted. That, and I used the suggestions of the
guide, played a few Skirmish missions to grind some experience, and learned the
"Damage Boost" Order by getting my Lancers to level 7. After that preparation, I
got an A rank on the mission!

Writing the above, I don't think I've mentioned Orders in any of my posts yet.
Orders are special abilities you can activate each turn by spending the required
amount of CP. Primarily, they're things like "increase Attack for selected
unit," but there are some that aren't buffs, like the ability to call down a
Mortar Strike centered on the specified enemy. That one costs 3 CP, but the
mortar seems to be *super* strong, so it's a fair cost.

After the mission I really struggled on, I think I finally started to understand
the mechanics enough that I stopped struggling so much. There was a cool mission
later on that gave the Edelweiss new equipment in the form of smokescreen
rounds. The Edelweiss can launch one of these to create a thick cloud of smoke
over an area. While units are standing in the smoke, they're invisible to the
enemy. In that mission, you're prompted to use this to make it past powerful
gatling turrets that would otherwise mow down your infantry. It's a cool
ability! I keep forgetting to use it in other missions though. On the mission
that introduced the smokescreen rounds, I did well enough to earn a B rank all
on my own! No guide on online tips needed.

A few missions after that came a big one. A direct confrontation against the
bulk of the Empire's invading force, all gathered in one area. But more
importantly, the enemy forces are led by Selvaria, who is a Valkyria and wields
the powerful weapons of her bloodline. The game explains all of this earlier on.
Basically, history tells of a powerful and technologically advanced race called
the Valkyrur. A Valkyria is someone descended from the Valkyrur, but they're all
but extinct in the modern age. When the Gallians first learn that the Empire has
a Valkyria on their side, it's a big blow against their morale. In this battle
too, with Selvaria leading the charge, things look grim.

While Selvaria decimates Gallian forces on another front of this battle, Squad 7
leads a charge to capture an enemy base camp. This was a fun mission. It takes
place almost entirely in trenches dug into the landscape. These trenches are the
only place safe from the barrage of rocket fire scorching the plains. The
trenches are narrow, and you never know when an enemy is around the corner. You
also start with no tanks, and no ability to use Orders since Welkin and the
Edelweiss aren't on the field. You first need to capture a camp on the other
side of the map to stop the rockets, and only then do your tanks arrive.
Unfortunately, they arrive at the same time as Selvaria. Her weapon can shoot a
powerful beam that destroys tanks in a single shot, so your only option is to
hide your tanks in pits dug into the landscape, and pelt her with tank mortar
fire. This doesn't hurt her, but it does stop her from moving for one turn.
While that was going on, I advanced with my infantry and eventually took the
enemy camp, successfully completing the operation.

Avoiding plot spoilers, I won't go into the events immediately following that
battle. A *lot* happens, and some plot threads from a few missions prior come
together in a great way. I really liked this writing, it made a lot of sense to
me, as did the way characters reacted to it. That's all I'll say! Enjoy this
unrelated picture of Squad 7 chilling in the desert.

Somehow, I still haven't had any die in the line of duty on my save. I'll seen
people die during a mission only to fail that mission a turns later, and
boy...these death scenes really make you feel guilty about letting a soldier
die. But none of those deaths have happened in my current save, so I guess it's
a good thing I got a few Game Overs along the way, as it let me restart the
mission and better plan my strategy to avoid deaths!
