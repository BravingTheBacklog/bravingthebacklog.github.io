Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

The only game I played over the past week was Persona 4 Golden on PC. I've kept
this post spoiler-free, and only cover events unrelated to the main story. If
you'd like to go into Persona 4 Golden completely blind, you may consider
skipping this post entirely!

I finished my playthrough this week!

Like last week, to avoid spoilers I'm going to steer clear of the main story
entirely. Instead, I'll just showcase a few screenshots of the various school
life events that occurred during my playtime this week.

Later in the game, I was able to fuse some pretty monstrous Personas, like
Satan. I also fused one called Tzitzimitl, which I have no idea how to pronounce
but I really liked using. My Tzitzimitl had the "Elec Amp" skill, a high Magic
stat, and powerful electric attacks, which all came together to create a very
lethal Persona provided the enemy was susceptible to electricity.

Well, that's it for P4G. It was every bit as excellent as my original
playthrough on my PlayStation TV! I'm really glad it came to Steam, and I'll say
one more time that I hope its successful Steam launch leads to more Atlus games
coming to Steam!
