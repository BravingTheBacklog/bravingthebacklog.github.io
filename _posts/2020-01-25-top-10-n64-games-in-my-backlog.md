The Nintendo 64 had some truly amazing games. Classics like The Legend of Zelda:
Ocarina of Time, Star Fox 64, Paper Mario, and numerous others fill its library.
I've played many of the definitive N64 games, but there are still a handful of
interesting games I missed out on, and they make up this Top 10 list!

<!--more-->

## 10. {% include game.html game="Aidyn Chronicles The First Mage" %}

A rare instance of an RPG on the N64, Aiden Chronicles has my interest for that
reason alone! It features turn-based battles in which you can move around the
battlefield, and a number of common RPG mechanics in a fantasy setting.

## 9. {% include game.html game="Hybrid Heaven" %}

In another example of an RPG on the N64, Hybrid Heaven distances itself from a
typical RPG in a number of ways. Primarily, the battle system is something of a
crossover between RPG and 3D Fighting game. It sounds pretty unique, and I'm
looking forward to seeing what it's like firsthand.

## 8. {% include game.html game="Star Wars Shadows of the Empire" %}

Set between The Empires Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, in Shadows of the
Empire you play as Dash Rendar, with 3rd-person shooter gameplay. Dash Rendar is
a Han Solo type character, and apparently featured in a Star Wars book as a
minor character before becoming the main protagonist of this game. It's also
available on PC, so there's a chance I might play that version instead,
depending on whether it runs properly on modern PCs.

## 7. {% include game.html game="Wonder Project J2 Corlo no Mori no Josette" %}

A sequel to a Super Famicom game, Wonder Project J2 features similar gameplay to
its predecessor. It's primarily a simulation game in which you teach and guide a
robot girl named Josette through various events.

This game was exclusive to Japan, and I only recently learned it existed and has
an English fan translation. The art and character sprites look awesome, and it
definitely seems worth giving a try!

## 6. {% include game.html game="Jet Force Gemini" %}

Jet Force Gemini is a 3rd-person shooter developer by Rare where you fight
against tons of insect-like enemies while exploring different planets in the
galaxy. It sounds like an interesting enough premise, and it has pretty positive
reviews, so I'm game to give it a try myself!

## 5. {% include game.html game="Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon" %}

In this action-adventure platformer, you control Goemon and his 3 friends,
exploring feudal Japan and fighting enemies. The historical setting is full of
zany humor and anachronistic elements, so that should definitely keep things
interesting.

## 4. {% include game.html game="Goemon's Great Adventure" %}

Another game in the Goemon series, Goemon's Great Adventure, it returns to the
side-scrolling platformer gameplay the series usually features. Like Mystical
Ninja Starring Goemon, it features similar humor. Reception of the game was
quite positive, which is encouraging!

## 3. {% include game.html game="Ogre Battle 64 Person of Lordly Calibur" %}

This is a strategy RPG with real-time elements during battle. You create
formations of units and deploy them, and a battle begins when they come in
contact with another group of units. I don't really have a good idea of how it
plays, but the concept sounds pretty intriguing. Plus, reviews are very
positive!

## 2. {% include game.html game="Banjo-Kazooie" %}

I've played bits of Banjo-Kazooie before, but never the whole thing. The
collect-a-thon gameplay does seem fun, but for whatever reason I've just not
stuck with this game through to the end before. Playing Super Mario Odyssey
definitely got me more interested in 3D platformers again, so I'm looking
forward to seeing what Banjo-Kazooie does to innovate in the genre!

## 1. {% include game.html game="Custom Robo 1" checkmark="" %}

**Edit**: Finished! It was an absolute joy to dive into the world of Custom Robo
again. You can [read more of my thoughts on it here]({% post_url
2020-06-01-what-im-playing-no-74 %}#CustomRobo)

The very first Custom Robo game. As a big fan of the GameCube game, "Custom
Robo," which is actually the 4th game in the series, I'm really looking forward
to playing the game that started it all, experiencing more wonderful
Robo-customization gameplay, and seeing what elements remain the same between
this game and the GameCube one.

This was Japan-only, but thankfully dedicated fans have created an English
translation patch!
