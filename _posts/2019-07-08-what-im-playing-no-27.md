Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Games contained within this post:

 - Animal Crossing: New Leaf *(3DS)*
 - Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia *(3DS)*
 - Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth *(3DS)*

### Animal Crossing: New Leaf *(3DS)*

A new villager moved in, Pinky! They're a pink panda, and they seem pretty cute!
I haven't spoken to them much yet though. I usually don't talk to my villagers a
whole lot, honestly. Maybe I'm missing out on a big part of the Animal Crossing
experience?

Caught a bunch of new cicadas for my museum one rainy day! That was really cool,
it was like every few steps I saw one on a tree and got the "I wonder what my
encyclopedia says about this" message.

Between my cicada catching and another trip I made to the island at night for
beetle catching, I caught enough bugs to get the Skilled Bug Catcher badge from
Phineas when I found him wandering around town! He also gave me a second badge,
Avid Bell Saver to commemorate the fact that I now have 1,000,000+ bells in
savings!

My 1,000,000+ bell count was reached by playing the Stalk Market this week, and
selling turnips. I checked the prices twice a day, once before noon and once
after, in order to make sure I didn't miss a sudden spike. I'd read up on turnip
price patterns, apparently in New Leaf there's only a few different general
patterns that the prices will follow. Knowing this, by Wednesday afternoon, I
thought I was one the Large Spike pattern. So, I planned to sell my turnips
Thursday afternoon, on what I thought would be the highest price for that week.
I sold them all to Reese for 133 bells per turnip. Since I bought them a 95
bells each, and I had about 3,400 turnips, I made a nice profit of around
129,000 bells. Out of curiosity, I checked the prices again after the next price
change, and found that it had increased to 163 bells per turnip! Turns out my
prices weren't on the Large Spike, they were on the Small Spike pattern. Oh
well, live and learn. I still made a decent turnip profit either way.

A new shop opened up on main street, it's a hair salon located above the Able
Sisters store! For 3,000 bells, the poodle proprietor of Shampoodle can give you
a new hairstyle. I haven't tried it yet though, because when I went in I'd just
deposited most of my bells and didn't have enough on hand!

### Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia *(3DS)*

I believe the end is slowly coming into view. My pace on Fire Emblem Echoes has
definitely slowed compared to the first two weeks playing it. I found myself
having to use Mila's Turnwheel *way* more often this week to avoid deaths. I
don't know if my strategy is bad or my units are bad, but it's probably some of
both. Assuming I get enough time to play it in the coming week, I'm hoping to be
able to check this one off on the backlog.

I don't want to stray into spoiler territory, so I'll keep things vague. Alm and
company were joined by the amnesiac Gold Knight Zeke. Gold Knight is a promoted
Paladin in this game, so Zeke is pretty darn strong. His resistance is pretty
low though, but I guess in Echoes high Resistance isn't a universal
Paladin/Cavalier/Gold Knight trait. In fact, Mathilda might be the only Paladin
with High Resistance in this game...? Seems that way in my playthrough, at
least.

It seems as though I reached as far as I can with Celica's army. Whether it's
the end of her story here, or if she'll be playable again, I don't know, but I
do know that I can now advance as Alm, and begin the final stretch of the
journey!

### Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth *(3DS)*

Although I didn't take many screenshots, I had a lot of fun casually playing PQ2
in shorter bursts this week. Still on Safety mode, as in prior weeks, as the
difficulty level just wasn't for me.

I related to Junpei and Futaba so much when they talked about their gaming
backlogs. Unlike Junpei though, it's not like I don't have time to play video
games, there are just a ton of games I want to play!

Other than that, there's not much notable progress to report. I've been chugging
along in what should be the final dungeon. I got this Genie persona from
Disney's Aladdin. I mean, technically this Persona is based on "djinn" from
folklore, but it has clearly taken inspiration from Disney's interpretation of
the source material.
