Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth came out in Japan on November 29th, 2018, and
on June 4th, 2019 for the rest of the world. It's a sequel of sorts to Persona
Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth, though the events of each game have no bearing on
the other. Both take elements from the Etrian Odyssey series, namely dungeon
crawling, and put elements from the Persona series alongside them.

Even though I didn't love the first game, my excitement over Persona was enough
to get me to pre-order Persona Q2. It made some nice improvements over the first
game, but I'm beginning to think the dungeon crawling genre might not be my cup
of tea. Read on to hear my full thoughts on the experience in this spoiler-free
review!

## Persona Dream Team

Like in the first game, the general premise is that the casts of several Persona
games find themselves inexplicably thrown into a strange world where they meet
for the first time and join forces. It's basically a fan fiction in that regard.
The plots of both games are considered non-canon I think, but the events don't
really intersect with the main canon anyway.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

This union of so many wonderful Persona characters is pretty great. It's
basically the reason I picked up the game! There are some charming interactions
between characters from different games, many of whom have never met in any
other Persona spin-off before. I'm sure there are a bunch of adorable scenes I
didn't even see, since I didn't do many side quests.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4VB6Jpw.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4VB6Jpwm.png"/></a>

</figure>

Most of the characters have good writing and seem true to their personalities
from the main Persona series. Their personality quirks are all exaggerated to
some extent, especially Akihiko. Persona Q1 had the same problem, where Akihiko
basically just talked about protein powder in every other scene, and competed
against Shinjiro in the rest. However, I do think they exaggerated Akihiko a
little less in Persona Q2, which is nice.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/obcaRh5.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/obcaRh5m.png"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/smaIeMd.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/smaIeMdm.png"/></a>
</figure>

One of the original characters, Hikari, is also written well. She starts out as
quite a mystery, but eventually you learn more about her, and more about her
personality. I thought her story was pretty touching.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BpZTBgs.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BpZTBgsm.png"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/L5IlVUG.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/L5IlVUGm.png"/></a>
</figure>

There are also plenty of silly moments, generally involving the otherworldly
attendants of the Velvet Room.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wtrvMTm.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wtrvMTmm.png"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GS4ANnv.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GS4ANnvm.png"/></a>
</figure>

The story's conclusion is especially strong. There's just an immense feeling of
closure, yet also some fun questions to ponder. It's not like they leave story
threads hanging or anything, but the final moments include a moment where the
meaning isn't spelled out, instead leaving it to the player to interpret as they
wish. Beyond that, the ending bombarded me with nostalgia. All the characters
get cute individual "farewell" dialogues as they part ways to return home. Then
afterward, you get to see each of the casts in a locale from their main Persona
game, and it was just so heartwarming to see everybody hanging out at those
places again!

## Dungeon Crawling

Like its predecessor, Persona Q2 is essentially the dungeon crawling formula of
Atlus's Etrian Odyssey series, but Persona-themed. I thought the dungeons were
well designed and fun this time around, with cool movie parodying themes.

These movie-centric themes were better than the ones in the previous game too,
they had more personality. Although, as a Jurassic Park fan, I might be biased
here since one of the dungeons in Persona Q2 is a Jurassic Park parody.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/36TPH8z.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/36TPH8zm.png"/></a>
</figure>

None of the dungeons felt tedious or irritating. Toward the end, I was worried
the dungeons would get stale or overstay their welcome. To my pleasant surprise,
I found them all to be a satisfying length. They also had unique mechanics to
offer, without becoming grating.

Since it's based on the Etrian Odyssey formula, Persona Q2 has you draw your own
maps using the bottom screen of your 3DS as you explore the dungeons. Both
Persona Q and Persona Q2 feature an option to automatically draw the floors as
you step on them. Persona Q2 also had an auto-draw walls option which I promptly
turned on.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0rLCOyO.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0rLCOyOm.png"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ac8eYfN.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ac8eYfNm.png"/></a>
</figure>

I'm a bit conflicted on the whole "draw your own map" concept. On one hand, it
seems a little silly that the game doesn't just auto-reveal the map. Maps that
are drawn automatically are pretty widespread in video games. On the other hand,
drawing the map myself is weirdly fun! There's something about it that is just
enjoyable. Even with the auto-floor and auto-wall option, I could still draw my
own walls as I saw areas that I couldn't yet reach in the distance across a gap.
You also have to manually place the locations of treasure chests, doors, secret
passages, and all other dungeon features. There's an odd satisfaction in seeing
your map slowly come together and getting a complete picture of all the elements
of the dungeon floor. Plus, I'm pretty sure the "draw your own map" concept is a
pretty integral part of Etrian Odyssey's identity, so I suppose it's only
natural they would keep that defining feature in the series (and spin-offs)
indefinitely.

## Battles

[![](https://i.imgur.com/2QM3syQm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/2QM3syQ.png)
{: .image-right }

The battle system has seen some updates and improvements since Persona Q1. For
whatever reason, the battles in both games never really had me hooked. I mean,
the battles are *fine* I guess. I assume the system is very similar to Etrian
Odyssey's battle system. Battles are turn-based, and even incorporate a system
similar to Persona's "1 More!" system in the form of the "Boost" system. Despite
all this, they just never clicked for me. It was fun for me on occasion, but
nowhere near as much fun as Persona's battle system.

Still, there are a number of nice new features.

### Unison Attacks

Unison Attacks have been added, where 2 or more characters team up to deliver a
bonus attack. These seem to be triggered randomly as long as one of the
characters involved in the Unison Attack is in your party.

Unison Attacks occur between specific sets of characters. They can only occur
after you've unlocked that specific Unison Attack. You unlock them by doing side
quests that feature that characters who will end up performing the Unison
Attack. The side quests are all optional, so whether or not you choose to unlock
many Unison Attacks is up to you. I didn't pursue many side quests, so I didn't
unlock many Unison Attacks.

The ones I did unlock were powerful, and they had cool animations and character
pair ups. For instance, there's one where Chie from Persona 4 and Ann from
Persona 5 pair up to "knock out enemies with their charm."

<figure class="third center">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NRgru4n.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NRgru4nm.png"/></a>
</figure>

### Baton Pass

The Baton Pass feature from Persona 5 is also present, but in a slightly
different form. It's now a support ability that you can have your navigator
activate, and costs 2 team gauge points. It functions mostly the same when
activated, and lets you transfer a "Boost" from one character to another.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/F53IU14.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/F53IU14m.png"/></a>
</figure>

Having Baton Pass available is a cool improvement over Persona Q1, but it's not
nearly as powerful as Persona 5's Baton Pass. They're very different games at
the end of the day though, so it doesn't pay for me to contrast their Baton Pass
feature too much. I didn't use it very often in Persona Q2 to be honest, but
it's probably a nice option to have on harder difficulties.

### Changing Battle BGM

There's an option to change the background music that plays during a battle. I
think the additional music options were actually DLC that I got for free by
pre-ordering or something? Or maybe from getting the premium edition of the
game? I'm not entirely sure, but it was really nice to have different music
during battles, especially when that music consists of the awesome battle themes
from Persona 3 through 5.

Persona Q2 also let you put the battle music on shuffle, so that you
automatically get a nice variety of music from battle to battle.

### Tough Boss Battles

I had started my playthrough on Normal difficulty, thinking that would be an
enjoyable challenge. When I started out, it was balanced well for battles
against regular enemies. But then I reached the first boss. The first time
around, he wiped the floor with me. I conceded defeat, and spent a little while
grinding for EXP to gain a few levels. When I re-challenged the boss, I was able
to success, but it was still a close call, and it still took a pretty long time.

With the first dungeon out of the way, I entered the second dungeon. The enemies
here were stronger, but I still felt the combat was balanced fairly for the
difficulty I had chosen. I made it all the way to the boss of the second dungeon
on Normal difficulty. Then I was put firmly in my place.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VS6obXN.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VS6obXNm.png"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/43yZvtE.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/43yZvtEm.png"/></a>
</figure>

The boss of the second dungeon *obliterated* me twice before I threw up my hands
and said, "Okay, game, you win. I'll switch to an easier difficulty." Now, I
probably could have beaten the boss on Normal, but I would have undoubtedly
needed to grind at least a few more levels, and stocked up on status healing
items and status prevention equipment to avoid the boss's irritating use of
status ailments that targeted the entire party. But the thought of doing all
that just didn't seem at all fun to me, and why play the game that way if I
wouldn't enjoy it? So, I switched the difficulty to Safety, the easiest option
where you can auto-revive your entire team if you die in battle, making Game
Overs a thing of the past, and never looked back.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/N43RErl.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/N43RErlm.png"/></a>
</figure>

All the boss battles were pretty much like this. Lengthy, difficult ordeals,
that would have required exceptional preparation for those playing on difficulty
levels where it was possible to fail. If you really enjoy the battle system,
this probably wouldn't bother you, or might even excite you. But the boss
battles, and battles in general here, just weren't for me. I am really glad that
Safety mode was an option though, there's a good chance I would have never
finished the game if it wasn't.

## Looking Good, 3DS!

One thing done especially well is the overall presentation on the 3DS.
Developing for a small resolution and screen like the 3DS has is no doubt a
challenge for developers. Despite this, the characters, environments, and UI all
look great. The UI has a lot of style, similar to Persona 5's UI in some ways,
and it is pretty awesome they managed to bring so much of that style to life on
the 3DS. The chibi-style used for the characters also probably serves as a way
to work around the resolution limitations of the 3DS, simplifying the look of
characters faces and their overall design.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/05IlcnO.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/05IlcnOm.png"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/1OrVmXd.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1OrVmXdm.png"/></a>
</figure>

2D animated cutscenes are used a number of times to portray story moments, and
they look gorgeous. I'm not sure what production company was behind them, and
the small screen resolution might actually be a boon here to hide sloppy
animation, but either way the end result looked great to me.

<figure class="third">

## Sadly, No English Dub

One of the biggest letdowns with the English release of Persona Q2 is the lack
of an English dub. The voice lines remains in Japanese throughout, with English
text and English subtitles during cutscenes. I knew about this well prior to the
English release, as it was announced in advance. Still, it would have been
awesome to hear the English voice actors from Persona 5 lend their voices to
their characters again, as they haven't appeared in many spin-offs yet (as of
this writing, only Persona 5 Dancing in Starlight, which received an English
dub, and Persona Q2).

Of course, I imagine the reason the localization doesn't include English voice
lines is likely due to how late in the 3DS's life this game released. Even when
it came out in Japan, in November 2018, the Switch was already over a year into
its life, so Atlus likely didn't expect huge sales figures.

The big problem with the lack of English voice lines is that some of the
Japanese voice lines aren't accompanied by text. Basically anything a character
says during regular battles is audio only, except for the important lines spoken
by the navigator. Even though the lines are non-essential, it still would be
nice to understand what little things the characters are saying during battle.

## Closing Thoughts

Persona Q2 improved over its predecessor in a number of significant ways. I'm
glad I played through it all, though it was primarily for the characters and
story. I did enjoy exploring the dungeons, but the random battles and the battle
system itself I wasn't super fond of.

If you're a fan of Persona and the dungeon crawler genre (bonus points if you're
a fan of Etrian Odyssey specifically), you'll probably *adore* Persona Q2. But
for me, it was a middling experience overall.
