### Persona 5 Strikers *(PS4)*    {#Persona5Strikers}

I fused Lucifer, the ultimate Persona in P5S this week, completing the Inmate
Registry and getting myself one step closer to 100% completion!

Battles on Merciless difficulty can go south *fast*, you have to focus on
dodging a lot more than normal, especially when fighting the bosses or
mini-bosses because a single attack can take away most of your health. Merciless
is lot of fun though, it's cool how it basically requires you to make the most
of your high level Personas and their strongest attacks.

I still have a ways to go maxing out the rest of the Bond skills in order to get
the platinum trophy. I've been playing through the game again skipping most
cutscenes, because replaying through everything seems like the fastest way to
gain Bond levels.

### Battle Chasers: Nightwar *(PC)*    {#BattleChasers:Nightwar}

I finished the game this week, and doing so was a relief because the final boss
was absolutely *brutal*. But I'll get to that shortly. Strangely, the boss of
the dungeon I ended the previous week's post on was a lot easier than some of
the common enemies in that dungeon. The dungeon afterward, which was also the
final dungeon of the game, wasn't as difficult as the other one, though there
still some *nasty* enemies within it. The boss of that dungeon was more
challenging than the previous one, and I was defeated by them one or two times
before I bested them. The fight felt *fair* though, it wasn't completely and
utterly ridiculous.

<figure class="third">

The final boss though? That's another story. I don't know in what way I
personally offended the developers, but I feel like I must've hurt them in some
way, and the final boss was their revenge against whatever injustice I committed
against them. There are just so many things stacked against the player in that
fight. The boss has an attack that damages the whole party and leaves them with
a bleed that deals about 1000 HP damage a turn for a few turns, so you need to
take care of healing that quickly. But while you're busy trying to recover from
that, it might hit a character with Rapture, which can crit for 11,000 HP if
you're unlucky, and if the character somehow survives that attack, they're
stunned for one turn anyway. But the worst thing was Blood Fortress. The enemy
AI *always* uses this ability once their health falls below a certain threshold.
Blood Fortress puts up a damage shield on the boss, and until you break through
the shield, each time the enemy's turn rolls around your whole party takes 1,000
damage each, and the enemy heals for around 1,700 HP. *And* it gets to attack
afterward too, using one of those oh-so-awful attacks I described earlier, or
maybe it'll hit you with Dark Star, a 30-hit attack that hits the whole party
for massive damage.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

After about 5 failed tries at taking down the boss, I decided I would need to
grind up a few levels, and then it would be a much more level playing field. So
I went off to the arena, and got Red Monika and Knolan to max level, which is
level 30 in this game. With 2 max level characters, the fight should be a lot
easier, right? Well, it at least made it easier for me to reliably reach the
Blood Fortress part of the battle, but once the party started taking that Blood
Fortress damage *and* the damage of another enemy attack each time it got a
turn, we got obliterated time after time. I don't even know how many times I
attempted the fight with that party build. I want to say it was around a dozen
times or so before I finally threw up my hands and said, "okay, this fight isn't
possible with this party."

<figure class="half">

</figure>

At that point, I took Knolan out of the party and replaced him with Alumon.
Alumon could also use healing spells, and his had the benefit of giving allies a
damage shield if the heal would put them over their full HP amount. Having a
damage shield in the final boss battle was basically *essential* given how hard
many of its attacks hit. I also did some running around to gather materials to
craft Garrison's ultimate weapon, which increased his damage output by a huge
amount. Feeling cautiously optimistic about my new party build, I went back at
it against the final boss...and proceeded to die in much the same way as earlier
another 6 times. But on that lucky number 7 attempt, the enemy missed a few
times, and I was finally able to deplete its Blood Fortress damage shield
without my entire party being super low on health. Victory was in my grasp at
that point, and I *finally* took down the boss. But the weird thing about that
attempt is, it felt *easy*. My strategy wasn't really any different than the
previous 6 times, but we just got lucky that time and it made a huge difference.

</figure>

Thus, my time with Battle Chasers: Nightwar came to an end. It was a fun game
overall, with a really cool battle system. But the final boss left a bad taste
in my mouth, and I'm frankly glad to be done with it. I would still recommend it
to JRPG fans, but just be aware that the final boss is unfair, and you'll lose
*hard* unless you have specific party builds and a bit of luck. The final time
on my save file was 38.6 hours, and I don't even want to know how much of that
time was spent attempting to defeat the final boss, then grinding and preparing
attempt the final boss battle again. I'm guessing it was probably the last 6 to
8 hours of it, maybe?

### Invisible Inc. *(PC)*    {#InvisibleInc}

This is a roguelike tactical espionage game from Klei, the developer behind
Don't Starve and Oxygen Not Included. Visually, it's just as great looking as
their other games, but with a distinct style.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/D4UHunD.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/D4UHunDm.jpg" alt="a distinct style"/></a>
</figure>

You control the remnants of a spy agency fighting against the evil corporations
of the world in a dystopian future. Gameplay is turn-based with fog of war, and
a strong emphasis on stealth. You can knock out enemies (or even kill them once
your agents get guns), but there's a several turn cooldown on your weapons, so
you can't go in guns blazing every time. Observing enemy patrol patterns,
peeking around corners, and hacking cameras are all essential to completing your
objective and getting your agents out alive in each mission. After each mission,
you upgrade your agents and outfit them with gear to prepare them for future
missions.

Over the course of the campaign, you'll choose which missions you want to
pursue, and based on how far way each one is from the previous, it'll subtract
hours from your timer accordingly. Once you time is up, you're thrust into the
final mission, whether you're prepared or not. I...was definitely not prepared.
Most enemies I ran into had heavy armor, and I hadn't managed to pick up any
weapons capable of piercing that kind of armor, so it was a pretty hopeless
situation. It felt like a mercy when my agents were finally put out of their
misery. That was the end of my first campaign run, but as is the way of
roguelikes, losing a run is just part of the process, and you gain permanent
progress for future runs like unlocking new agents.

All told, my whole campaign playthrough took around 3, maybe 4 hours. I really
enjoyed it up until the final mission. Being so unprepared for that one was
pretty disheartening. It definitely gives me an idea of what I should be
preparing for in future campaign runs though, and I'm looking forward to giving
it another try eventually, but I'm going to take a break from it for the time
being!
