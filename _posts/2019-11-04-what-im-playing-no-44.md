Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

There are some late game plot arc and final boss spoilers for Valkyria
Chronicles in this one *but* I believe I've kept it free of the most surprising
spoiler moments. Still though, if you intend to play Valkyria Chronicles for
yourself someday and don't want anything spoiled, skip the Valkyria Chronicles
section!

Click a title to skip to that section. Games contained within this post:

### Valkyria Chronicles *(PC)*    {#ValkyriaChronicles}

I finished Valkyria Chronicles, and my overall reaction is this: what a game! It
was such an emotional ride through the latter half of the game, and the writing
just had me saying "wow" time after time.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4bAHKUP.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4bAHKUPm.jpg" alt="I finished Valkyria Chronicles"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/C6HDukC.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/C6HDukCm.jpg" alt="what a game"/></a>
</figure>

I'll outline the general path to the end of the game, but I'm going to avoid the
moments that really surprised me to avoid spoiling *everything*. If you haven't
played Valkyria Chronicles yet, and are still reading this, just know that I've
left out some of the best moments in the writing and story (throughout my past
write-ups as well), because I think those moments are best experienced
firsthand.

Once I reached the final chapter, I figured out how to go back and play through
the optional Report chapters I'd purchased from Castlefront Street at the
Headquarters. I decided to go back and play them all. Better late than never,
right? It was interesting to see where each one fit in the story, as they're
positioned between the chapter pages where they fit. I'm so glad I went back and
played them all, because they add a nice bit of backstory and personality to the
characters.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/eLyeBBo.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eLyeBBom.jpg" alt="Report"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vwKBZvM.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vwKBZvMm.jpg" alt="personality"/></a>
</figure>

Most of the optional reports center around a specific character. Like the main
story chapters, they generally have a few cutscenes and a battle to fight. These
battles were really cool! Most of them had you use very small squads and had
unique victory conditions. One has Welkin, Largo, and a unit of your choice
stealthily navigating on foot through a town at night to take out some Imperials
blocking a trade route. Again, I'm *so* glad I went back and played these,
because they give more life to the characters of Squad 7. Beating them also
unlocks a unique Potential for that character! And if I hadn't played them, I
would have never known about Largo's obsession with vegetables, and that would
have been a crying shame.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WkzvUX8.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WkzvUX8m.jpg" alt="vegetables"/></a>
</figure>

Anyway, aside from the optional Reports, I obviously continued and completed the
main story as well. First Squad 7 faced off against Selvaria. She fought without
using her powers as a Valkyria this time. Wielding a powerful machine gun, she
was still very much a threat, even without her superhuman powers. My infantry
had to dodge her barrage of bullets lest they be torn to shreds. Between a
combination of the Edelweiss's smoke rounds and timing my units movement until
Selvaria had to reload, eventually victory was mine!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/9BkfpHT.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9BkfpHTm.jpg" alt="Selvaria"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AD2AGnp.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AD2AGnpm.jpg" alt="victory was mine"/></a>
</figure>

The Imperial Prince himself then lead a gargantuan tank, the Marmota, against
the Gallian capital. Despite Squad 7 doing everything in their power to stop it,
they were unable to take it down before it reached the capital!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/B3RrMft.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/B3RrMftm.jpg" alt="the Marmota"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/r4PtiXQ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/r4PtiXQm.jpg" alt="reached the capital"/></a>
</figure>

Fighting their way to reach the capital and take down the Marmota, they first
had to face off against the enemy general Jaeger. He showed up much earlier in
one of the main missions in the same tank, and at that point we just had to
avoid him. Now Squad 7 had no choice but to take him down, and it's pretty
satisfying to reach that point since it really puts your units growth in
strength over the course of the game into perspective. Plus, this takes place at
the same location as Squad 7's first real mission, and I *really* like the
symmetry that gives their journey.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ketC7rZ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ketC7rZm.jpg" alt="Jaeger"/></a>

</figure>

[![time to take down the Marmota](https://i.imgur.com/c1CIJjIm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/c1CIJjI.jpg)
{: .image-right }

At the outskirts of the capital, it was time to take down the Marmota. There
were many enemy reinforcements during this mission, as well as a lot of gatling
and anti-tank turrets lining the Marmota itself. I dealt with this by using the
All Units Defend order, making it easier for them to survive the onslaught of
gatling turret bullets. Then all I had to do was get a few Lancers to climb the
ladders by the turrets and deliver some explosives to their weak points, and the
turrets were no more. It was smooth sailing after that.

With the Marmota disarmed, Squad 7 boarded it to take down its captain:
Maximilian. As the final boss, Maximilian is using artificial Valkyrian weapons
to give himself the power of a Valkyria. Luckily, his artificial invulnerability
was easy to byass. I just directed my soldiers to take down the towers powering
his weapons. Once he was vulnerable, I pelted him with mortars from the
Edelweiss, resupplied it with an Engineer, and repeated the process. After a few
turns, he was defeated just like every enemy before him.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZIuHCE9.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZIuHCE9m.jpg" alt="Squad 7"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Thvx5qJ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Thvx5qJm.jpg" alt="he was defeated"/></a>
</figure>

After Maximilian's defeat, the entire Marmota begins to explode. Welkin and
Alicia get separated from the rest of the squad, and Welkin orders them to get
themselves to safety. Things aren't looking too good for the two stranded
members of Squad 7. At the last moment, their friend from the R&D department, an
engineer named Leon, flies in on a plane he finally finished building. Welkin
and Alicia jump and land safely on the back of the plane, and the trio fly off
towards Randgriz to reunite with the rest of their squad.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wR6icCw.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wR6icCwm.jpg" alt="the trio fly off"/></a>
</figure>

The credits start to roll soon after. It was such a beautiful way to end things,
with the plane flying off into distant skies. Cutscenes from the journey play
during the credits as a few nice instrumental tracks accompany them. You're also
shown all the soldiers you had recruited during your playthrough, and whether
they're alive or dead. I'm happy to report that I had no deaths!

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/1RnCEcv.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1RnCEcvm.jpg" alt="credits start to roll"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/kxjs6J0.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kxjs6J0m.jpg" alt="the soldiers you had recruited"/></a>
</figure>

There are also character epilogues during the credits sequence. I love this kind
of thing in every game I've played that has them. With the war over, everyone
returns to a peaceful life, and lives happily ever after. Welkin fulfills his
dream of wanting to be a teacher, and Alicia fulfills her dream of wanting to be
a baker. And of course, the two of them got married, and in the final scene you
see them walking off with their daughter to bake bread as a family. It's such a
sweet ending scene, I love it!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Fpzyvta.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fpzyvtam.jpg" alt="character epilogues"/></a>

</figure>

So that's it for Valkyria Chronicles. There are a few other games in the series:
2 sequels on the PSP, although Valkyria Chronicles 3 only released in Japan (but
there's a fan-made English translation patch!), and Valkyria Chronicles 4, which
is for Switch/PS4/Xbox One/PC. I'm definitely going to play more of the series
someday! The gameplay, story, and world of Valkyria Chronicles really impressed
me, and I'm looking forward to when I next return to the world of Europa for
more turn-based warfare!

### Disney Classic Games: Aladdin and The Lion King *(Switch)*    {#DisneyClassicGames:AladdinandTheLionKing}

PatronusLight and I had heard about this compilation a while back, and it
finally came out this week, releasing on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wzOyGd8.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wzOyGd8m.jpg" alt="it finally came out this week"/>
        <figcaption>It finally came out this week!</figcaption>
    </a>
</figure>

It contains the Sega Genesis versions of Aladdin and The Lion King.
Additionally, it contains the Game Boy and Super Game Boy versions of both
games, though these versions are considerably more stripped down due to the less
powerful hardware. The SNES version of The Lion King is also included, although
the graphics and sound are the only real difference. Gameplay remains basically
identical between the two.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/As0F1w7.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/As0F1w7m.jpg" alt="Super Game Boy"/></a>
</figure>

[![save states](https://i.imgur.com/moEeYnfm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/moEeYnf.jpg)
{: .image-right }

The games are being emulated, which is expected since that's far easier than
porting the games to run on PS4/Switch/Xbox One natively. The emulation itself
is great in my opinion, but I've never been one to really notice small accuracy
differences or disparities in sound reproduction from the original hardware.
With the games running via emulation, the developers also included some
emulation niceties: rewinding and save states. Or, save *state*, I should say.
You can only have one save per game. This initially struck me as odd since there
are rarely such strict limitations in open source emulators, but I think what
they were going for is to keep it simple. Simple enough that a child could
easily understand how to create and load a save, without needing them to
navigate through a menu full of several save states. I'll give the devs the
benefit of the doubt there.

Rewinding in these games is a *godsend*, especially in The Lion King. The Lion
King is known for being a very difficult retro game. Some of the platforming
required is deceptively precise, and there's an infamous monkey puzzle in the
second level. As a kid, I could never make it past the second level. Well, with
the help of the rewind feature saving me from numerous deaths, and my big adult
brain, I was able to make it past that level, and that was a pretty awesome
feeling!

<figure class="center">
    <div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(70.80% + 44px)'>
        <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/unfitexcellentbee' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
</figure>

One thing that's a little odd is that the SNES version of Aladdin isn't present
here. Unlike with The Lion King, the SNES version of Aladdin is an entirely
different game from the Genesis version. It was developed by Capcom, and that
could be the reason why it's absent? Capcom might not want to license the game
code or something, I'm not sure. But to make up for this absence, there's an
early demo build of the Genesis Aladdin included as well, and that's an
interesting bit of history.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VsA61cs.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VsA61csm.jpg" alt="early demo build"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Z9djWFs.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z9djWFsm.jpg" alt="Genesis Aladdin"/></a>
</figure>

Oh, one last funny thing, the words Nintendo, Sega, and Game Boy are strangely
avoided when referring to the game versions. They're referred to as S Console
version or N Console version, and Handheld version or Handheld Color version.
I'm not sure why this is, but it's pretty amusing.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Gramsyy.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gramsyym.jpg" alt="Handheld version"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6d1NKhZ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6d1NKhZm.jpg" alt="Handheld Color"/></a>
</figure>

Besides the games themselves, there's also a *ton* of content in the "Museum"
for each game. Lots of video interviews with the developers of the games, and
artwork from the games and movies.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5BZno05.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5BZno05m.jpg" alt="Museum"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dARfovr.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dARfovrm.jpg" alt="artwork"/></a>
</figure>

There's also a basic achievement system, which makes sense since the other
platforms this released on, PS4 and Xbox One, both have online achievements. The
Switch...doesn't, but the achievements can still be viewed and unlocked locally,
which is neat. They just won't sync to any sort of online profile like on the
other platforms. The achievements are pretty straightforward. Basically just
playing and beating the games on different difficulty levels and playing all the
versions of them will get you 100% of the achievements. *But*, I'm guessing
doing so would be far from easy since one of the 3 Lion King achievements is to
beat the game on the hardest difficulty. I would need a *lot* of rewind power to
do that.

</figure>

Playing these classic Disney games has been fun. I owned a version of The Lion
King as a kid, although I can't remember if it was for SNES or Genesis, so
that's been really nostalgic for me. PatronusLight owned Genesis Aladdin, so
seeing that game again is super nostalgic for her. All in all, it's a fun game
to pick up and play, and I think it will be nice to have it on the Switch to
play in handheld mode occasionally. We haven't tried that yet though!

### Ring Fit Adventure *(Switch)*    {#RingFitAdventure}

PatronusLight and I also picked up Ring Fit Adventure this week! It comes with a
new peripheral: the Ring-Con. And a leg strap but that's less exciting. The
right joy-con slides into the Ring-Con and you hold it like it's a Wii steering
wheel, and the left joy-con slides the leg strap which gets strapped around your
left thigh, and then you're ready to enter the Ring Fit world!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3PttcX8.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3PttcX8m.jpg" alt="Ring Fit Adventure"/></a>

</figure>

Ring Fit Adventure is a fitness RPG. You do exercises to explore a fantasy world
and fight monsters, gaining experience and leveling up as you do. That's great
for me, because I love video games, especially RPGs, but don't like exercising.
Nintendo has found a way to trick me into exercising, and like it!

<figure class="third">

</figure>

Seriously, Adventure mode, the main mode of the game, is legitimately fun. It's
not just a gimmick. Fighting enemies in turn-based battles, choosing attacks,
and defeating said enemies is addicting. It's just like other RPGs in that
regard. The RPG mechanics are simple, with your character only having Attack,
Defense, and HP stats, but that's fine with me. The full breadth of RPG staples
are here though: attacks that damage multiple enemies in battle, towns with NPCs
and stores, equipment to buy and increase your stats...they're all here!

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/X9FHBzj.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/X9FHBzjm.jpg" alt="Adventure mode"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6Q95k7L.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6Q95k7Lm.jpg" alt="stats"/></a>
</figure>

As an RPG, Adventure mode has a story as well. After creating your character,
you appear in the world of Ring Fit, and find a strange ring. It speaks to you,
asking you to set it free, so you do. Turns out that was a bad move. You release
Dragaux, a super buff dragon of darkness, and he starts radiating his evil
across the world, creating monsters like a typical RPG baddie.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ghJuubn.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ghJuubnm.jpg" alt="creating your character"/></a>

    </div>
</figure>

[![Ring](https://i.imgur.com/UIFzThwm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/UIFzThw.jpg)
{: .image-right }

As Dragaux flies away, you hear a different voice. It's the ring that Dragaux
was trapped in, but now it has a face and is talking and looking at you. The
ring's name is, creatively, Ring. Ring asks for your help to defeat Dragaux, and
with the two of you working together you gain access to great Fit Power, which
makes your hair fiery. With that, you're ready to play/exercise!

<figure class="center">
    <div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(70.80% + 44px)'>

    </div>
</figure>

You're then dropped into the first world map. Each world is split up into a few
levels and ends with a boss battle. A level has you jog in place to make your
character run through the world, additionally squeezing and pulling the Ring-Con
to shoot blasts of air and suck up coins and other items alongside the path.
You'll also encounter enemies along the path and fight those. These sections are
on-rails; you can't direct your character where to go, they follow a preset path
and simply move forward. That's fine though, having to explore freely by jogging
and pointing or turning the Ring-Con probably wouldn't be a frustration-free
control scheme anyway.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5PlQSCU.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5PlQSCUm.jpg" alt="first world map"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/jO4Unex.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jO4Unexm.jpg" alt="encounter enemies"/></a>
</figure>

The game just makes me smile and laugh. It's so funny how a lot of the world is
fitness-related. You run past dumbbells and other fitness gear as you explore,
and some of the enemies themselves resemble weights. It's not at all subtle and
I love it!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oFRTQUV.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oFRTQUVm.jpg" alt="the enemies themselves resemble weights"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AWvqSyt.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AWvqSytm.jpg" alt="not at all subtle"/></a>
</figure>

Of course, it's not all about having fun. One of the main goals of a fitness
game is to get fit. I won't know exactly how effective Ring Fit is at that until
I've been playing it longer, and fitness isn't just about exercise but also diet
and other factors, but I can at least say at this point that Adventure mode is a
*workout*. You can adjust the difficulty to fit your exercise needs and current
fitness level, and I picked a difficulty I thought I could handle. Well, I can
handle it, but by the end of a session in Adventure mode, I am dripping with
sweat. So, I think Ring Fit Adventure does its job as a fitness device quite
well so far!

<figure class="half">

</figure>

Now, I most likely won't write about Ring Fit Adventure in future What I'm
Playing posts. The story isn't going to win any awards (at least not so far),
and I've already covered the gist of the mechanics in this post. The mechanics
seem like they'll expand a bit as you progress. Even this week, a sort of "super
effective moves" or "enemy weakness" system in battle based on color coded
enemies matching up with the colors of your attacks was introduced once I
reached a certain point in the story. But unless the new mechanics radically
change the gameplay, I don't think I'll feel the need to write about them. I
intend to keep playing Ring Fit Adventure, and I really want to make it a habit
and get it into my daily routine. But you shouldn't expect to see more write-ups
on it here!
