In the grand scheme of things, the Wii is a pretty strange game console. One
look at the controller next to a lineup of other controllers is enough to tell
you that. The motion controls were utilized in very entertaining ways in some
games, and shoehorned in as gimmicky "waggle tech" mechanics in others. I have a
lot of fond memories of playing Wii games of both kinds, but in retrospect it
seems like I enjoyed games with more traditional controls more. Here's a list of
my top 10 favorite Wii games!

<!--more-->

A disclaimer before we start, some games just *barely* missed this list. One
that comes to mind is WarioWare: Smooth Moves. I had forgotten about that game
for years, but something reminded me about it a while back, and that was sort of
the driving force to creating this list. Unfortunately for WarioWare, I kept
remembering more and more Wii games I enjoyed and it eventually fell to the
bottom spot on the list, and then got pushed off entirely.

Also, I haven't played The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, so you won't find
that here!

## 10. {% include game.html game="LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga" %}

The title is a little ironic now that there's a full 3 movies beyond what once
was the "Complete Saga," but that doesn't change the fact that this is an
awesome LEGO game. At least, I really enjoyed it. Playing through episodes 1
through 6 of Star Wars presented in an adorable LEGO form was awesome, and I
enjoyed it so much I eventually gathered all collectibles.

## 9. {% include game.html game="Tales of Symphonia Dawn of the New World" %}

When I initially played this game, I thought it was a fun but disappointing
sequel to Tales of Symphonia. When I replayed it on PS3 as part of the Tales of
Symphonia Chronicles compilation, I enjoyed it a lot more! In both versions, the
battle system is improved from the original Tales of Symphonia on GameCube, and
adds nice options like a free run ability in battle. The biggest letdown was the
fact that the characters from the first game take a backseat in this one.
Instead, the story follows two new characters: Emil and Marta. They can be
annoying at times, but I did grow to like them, and the journey they get caught
up in is pretty interesting with some fun twists.

## 8. {% include game.html game="Mario Kart Wii" %}

Mario Kart Wii came with the "Wii Wheel," which housed the Wii remote and was
supposed to provide a more immersive motion control driving experience, I guess?
I played the game with that control scheme a bit, but I'm really glad it also
supported GameCube controllers, since that's the control scheme I used most of
the time. I've always been only casually into the Mario Kart series. Racing
games aren't really my thing, with the exception of Mario Kart, so I've never
really analyzed and compared drifting mechanics between the games. Anyway, I
really enjoyed this game. The addition of bikes added more variety to vehicles,
and allowed you to do wheelies to gain speed boosts.

## 7. {% include game.html game="Metroid Prime 3 Corruption" %}

Though I'd say it's my least favorite in the trilogy since it's much more
narrative focused, and less driven by player exploration than the previous
games, Metroid Prime 3 was still a great game. I don't remember specifically how
comfortable the controls were, since I haven't played this in a long time, but I
don't remember any major issues. The story is quite an adventure, and it was a
properly epic closing to the original Prime trilogy.

## 6. {% include game.html game="Rock Band 2" %}

Rock Band 2 probably seems like a weird pick for a favorite Wii game, but I have
a ton of fond memories playing it and the original on Wii. The reason it's here
over the first game is that it's a much more full-featured port than the
original Rock Band on Wii. It allows you create and customize characters, and
has support for DLC, both of which the first game lacked on Wii. I had a ton of
fun playing songs with the guitar and drum peripherals with my friends and
family, and sometimes I miss the era when games like this were popular.

I also enjoyed the Wii version of The Beatles Rock Band spin-off game, though
that was more for the music and Beatles history since it had fewer features than
a main entry in the series.

## 5. {% include game.html game="Super Smash Bros. Brawl" %}

Brawl marked a turning point for Smash Bros.. For the first time, third-party
characters were being included in the roster. The addition of Sonic and Snake
transformed the series from a celebration of Nintendo franchises to a
celebration of video games as a whole. Though Brawl might not be good for
competitive play, I've only ever played Smash Bros. casually, and it was
excellent in that regard! Chock full of new characters, stages, items, and the
jaw-dropping Final Smash attacks, Super Smash Bros. Brawl was a dream come true.
Plus, it had a full story mode with Subspace Emissary, and it was awesome seeing
the characters meet up on that journey!

## 4. {% include game.html game="The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess" %}

This game is the reason I wanted to get a Wii in the first place. I'm not
entirely sure why, because it came out on GameCube as well. Maybe I didn't know
it was coming to GameCube at the time? Although the Wii version did come out
about a month earlier than the GameCube version, so maybe I just couldn't wait
to get my hands on it. Either way, it was the first Wii game I owned, besides
Wii Sports which came with the console. Admittedly, the Wiimote and nunchuck
aren't the best control scheme. Aiming with the Wiimote is kind of gimmicky, but
it worked well enough, and at the time I probably thought it was the coolest
thing ever. The non-standard controller didn't bog me down though. Twilight
Princess on the Wii blew me away!

It had this dark, mature storyline, set in a realistic and gritty Hyrule. Combat
was expanded with awesome features like finishing moves, counterattacks, and
mounted combat. There were new twists on familiar equipment, like the Gale
Boomerang and the Clawshot. Twilight Princess isn't my favorite Zelda game,
because when I most recently tried to replay it I got fatigued from the sheer
number of dungeons in this game. But it's still a *wonderful* entry in the
series, provides a wonderfully unique depiction of Hyrule, and it still has
moments that I really love. Also, I has some of the best music in the series,
and the Hyrule Field theme still gets stuck in my head randomly.

## 3. {% include game.html game="Super Mario Galaxy" %}

Super Mario Galaxy I think remains the only 3D Mario game I've collected all the
stars in. I had played a bit of Super Mario 64 before, but never beaten it, and
Super Mario Sunshine, but never got all the Shine Sprites. But Galaxy just
caught my attention and didn't let go until every star was in my possession. At
that point, I remember unlocking Luigi as a playable character, which was
awesome! I don't think I collected all the stars as Luigi as well, so I guess I
didn't technically 100% complete the game as some stars are only available once
the rest of the stars have been collected by both Mario and Luigi. Even so, I
played a lot of Super Mario Galaxy, and loved its environments, gameplay, and
music!

## 2. {% include game.html game="Super Paper Mario" %}

Super Paper Mario took large steps away from its predecessors by replacing the
turn-based combat with mostly platforming-based combat, and in that regard it
feels much more like Super Mario Bros. than it does Paper Mario. The main hook
here is that you can switch between 2D and 3D modes to discover new parts of the
environment and solve puzzles. It's like the Paper Mode mechanic of
Thousand-Year Door on steroids, and it makes for some interesting puzzles and
gameplay. Super Paper Mario has a great story and characters, and the writing
fully maintains the zany aesthetic of Thousand-Year Door. It's a very good game
if you're looking for a unique action RPG.

## 1. {% include game.html game="Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn" %}

The trailers for this game got me so hyped for it. I was a big fan of Path of
Radiance on GameCube, so a sequel to that game was *super* exciting. After
watching the trailers numerous times waiting for the game to come out,
eventually it was in my hands.

I'll admit, initially I was thrown off by the start of the story. You don't play
as Ike until several chapters into the game, instead controlling the new
character Micaiah and her friend, the returning character Sothe. I grew to
appreciate the new characters too though, and the combat was every bit as good
as Path of Radiance. I don't remember exactly all the changes that were made
between the two games. I think the Laguz work differently, and probably a few
other mechanics were added and updated too. It was a fantastic game, with an
epic story. I have more fond memories of Path of Radiance, but Radiant Dawn is a
fantastic game as well, and definitely a worthy follow up in my mind.
