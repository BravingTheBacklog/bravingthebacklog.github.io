Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

We've reached the final What I'm Playing post of 2019. Whether you're here for
the first time, or you've been reading since post number 1, thanks for visiting!

My Luigi's Mansion section is spoiler-free, though there's not really much to
spoil in that game. For Breath of the Wild, I've spoiled the general premise and
backstory of the plot. If you want to go in without knowing that, then skip that
section this week!

### Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon *(3DS)*    {#LuigisMansionDarkMoon}

I played through Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon this week! For some reason, it's only
in North America that it was given this name. The rest of the world knows it as
Luigi's Mansion 2, which I think makes far more sense. Maybe Nintendo of America
was afraid of branding it as a full sequel since it does deviate from the
original in a number of ways? Whatever the case, it was a fun experience, and a
solid follow-up to the original!

In the beginning, Professor E. Gadd is researching and living with peaceful
ghosts in the Evershade Valley. The ghosts there are peaceful due to the effects
of the mysterious Dark Moon that hangs in the sky. However, when a mysterious
silhouette shatters the Dark Moon, the ghosts become mischievous and violent.

</figure>

In response to this, E. Gadd flees to his underground bunker, and summons up his
go-to ghost-hunting lackey, Luigi against his will. He asks Luigi to seek out
the pieces of the Dark Moon so it can be made whole again. E. Gadd again brings
his inventions and knowledge of ghosts to the table to help Luigi, but the rest
is up to the lovable and fearful green Mario brother.

</figure>

There are a number of changes to the formula compared to the original Luigi's
Mansion, but the core of the experience is the same. You'll guide Luigi to
explore rooms, find keys, solve puzzles, and suck up ghosts with your trusty
Poltergust vacuum. The mechanics of the ghost-catching are slightly tweaked, in
that you now need to press a button to shoot a stronger flashlight pulse at
ghosts to stun them, instead of just hitting them with the normal light from
your flashlight.

</figure>

[![charge up a meter](https://i.imgur.com/Dc06yHQm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/Dc06yHQ.png)
{: .image-right }

You also charge up a meter while pulling against them as Luigi vacuums them up,
and when the meter is charged pressing A nets you bonus damage and keeps them
from escaping the Poltergust's pull for a while longer. These tweaks to the
ghost-catching mechanics worked pretty well, although having to "shoot" the
flashlight at ghosts to stun them is a little weird in premise, but it works
well as a gameplay element.

Additionally, there's a new exploration mechanic introduced early in the game.
Certain objects are invisible due to the presence of Spirit Balls. Shining your
Dark-Light Device will reveal these objects temporarily, and flush out the
Spirit Balls that are concealing it. Vacuuming up the Spirit Balls will dispel
the illusion, making the object permanently visible and allowing you to interact
with it normally. This is used in many puzzles throughout the game, and there
are also a bunch of doors hidden this way. It was a pretty fun mechanic, and
apparently it returns in Luigi's Mansion 3 as well!

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SjoizFI.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SjoizFIm.png" alt="Dark-Light Device"/></a>
</figure>

One of the biggest changes to the gameplay structure compared to the first game
is that Dark Moon is mission based. The first game was sort of structured the
same way behind the scenes, with Luigi returning to E. Gadd after collecting
certain portrait ghosts, Dark Moon takes this much further and has actual
missions/levels. I haven't played it in a long time, but I think I prefer the
structure of the original game. That said, the design of Luigi's Mansion Dark
Moon is still fun. The missions are bite-sized, likely to adapt the formula to
shorter handheld gaming sessions, and a single mission took me, on average,
about 15 minutes, with the longest ones taking around 30 minutes if I got stuck
on a puzzle for a while.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KFD9oqE.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KFD9oqEm.png" alt="mission based"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UG8yWYN.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UG8yWYNm.png" alt="15 minutes"/></a>
</figure>

Another big change is that rather than taking place in a single mansion like the
first game, Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon has you visit 5 different mansions over
the course of the game. Each mansion was fun to explore, but I did find myself
thinking back longingly to the single, large mansion of the first game from time
to time.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/agfQtuF.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/agfQtuFm.png" alt="5 different mansions"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/44FW2yS.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/44FW2ySm.png" alt="Each mansion"/></a>
</figure>

Lastly, there are no portrait ghosts in this game. Portrait ghosts were the
bosses and mini-bosses of the first game, but here they're mostly replaced by
more generic ghosts. The bosses in this game are mostly "possessor" ghosts, who
all look pretty much the same, and fight you by possessing something and
attacking you. The boss battles themselves were okay, but I feel like they're
not as good as the portrait ghost boss battles of the first game. That could
just be nostalgia talking though.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/niOQTXq.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/niOQTXqm.png" alt="possessing something and attacking you"/></a>
</figure>

I could ramble on more about the differences between the first 2 Luigi's Mansion
games, but I'll leave it there for now. There are aspects of each game I prefer.
Both have a lot of charm though, and are fun games that give Luigi a moment in
the spotlight!

### Super Mario Odyssey *(Switch)*    {#SuperMarioOdyssey}

I played a little more Odyssey this week, and collected a few more Power Moons
by just wandering around or doing some shepherding. You know, the usual!

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UtXtgxf.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UtXtgxfm.jpg" alt="doing some shepherding"/></a>
</figure>

My Power Moon total is up to 520 now, but I feel like there's still so many left
to collect! Running and jumping around to find them still hasn't gotten old
though, it's just so much fun!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QPlIN1b.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QPlIN1bm.jpg" alt="520 now"/></a>

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild *(Switch)*    {#TheLegendofZelda:BreathoftheWild}

I finally started Breath of the Wild this week!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/kBrjlLa.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kBrjlLam.jpg" alt="Breath of the Wild"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4bp74i4.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4bp74i4m.jpg" alt="this week"/></a>
</figure>

I'll briefly summarize the premise as revealed in the Great Plateau during the
beginning of the game. 100 years ago, Link was gravely injured fighting against
Ganon with Princess Zelda. Link awakens, healed, in the Shrine of Resurrection
after sleeping for 100 years. He picks up the Sheikah Slate, an advanced little
tablet that can activate Sheikah relics, which causes towers and shrines across
Hyrule to re-activate. He gains several Rune powers from shrines around the
Great Plateau. Then, the spirit of the King of Hyrule explains how Ganon took
control of the Guardians and Divine Beasts, ancient weapons the Hylians intended
to use to seal Ganon away, and with them laid waste to Hyrule. The King lost his
life to the Guardians, but his daughter Zelda survived. Even now, Zelda remains
at Hyrule Castle, keeping Ganon contained there. But her power is waning. It's
up to Link to help her defeat Calamity Ganon, and end the threat to the kingdom!

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HW0CH3L.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HW0CH3Lm.jpg" alt="up to Link"/></a>
</figure>

With that, you are given the Paraglider, and finally have a means to safely
leave the Great Plateau. From there, you're free to explore Hyrule. You could
guide Link directly to Hyrule Castle. However, the King advises that this would
be foolish, and instead advises you to seek out Impa at Kakariko Village. So,
that's exactly what I set out to do!

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZkXLwry.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZkXLwrym.jpg" alt="this would be foolish"/></a>
</figure>

Of course, given the open world nature of the game, I got distracted along the
way. I stumbled upon a Korok, collecting a seed from it, got the Spirit Orb from
a Shrine along the way. After discovering my first stable, I found and tamed my
first horse, who I named Scrub. It's named after a Deku Scrub. I forgot how fun
riding a horse around Hyrule in a Zelda game is. Especially in Breath of the
Wild with its expansive world! Plus, you can attack from on horseback, similar
to how you were able to in Twilight Princess but this feels more polished.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JtbrpfV.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JtbrpfVm.jpg" alt="Korok"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JZqZspQ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JZqZspQm.jpg" alt="Scrub"/></a>
</figure>

Riding my trusty horse Scrub, I went exploring and found Hateno Village. I found
the Dye Shop here, where you can pay to dye your current set of armor, choosing
from a wide selection of colors. I went with light blue. It doesn't have any
effect on the stats of your equipment at all from what I can tell, but I'd still
consider it money well spent. With the armor and bandana died light blue, Link
looks like he's ready to join Team Aqua from Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

[![Kakariko Village](https://i.imgur.com/w7stoDEm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/w7stoDE.jpg)
{: .image-right }

After that, I got back on track pursuing my main quest to find Impa, and finally
made it to Kakariko Village. The Sheikah have always been like Hyrule's version
of ninja's, but the Japanese-sounding music and architecture of Kakariko Village
in Breath of the Wild really solidify this idea.

Anyway, I spoke with Impa and she had another quest for me, directing me to find
a Sheikah researcher at the lab near Hateno Village. Luckily since my detour
took me to the Shrine near there earlier, I could fast travel back! I quickly
found the researcher, Purah. With her help, the final rune of the Sheikah Slate
was unlocked: the Camera.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nu0U5Zo.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nu0U5Zom.jpg" alt="Impa"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FxUcngT.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FxUcngTm.jpg" alt="Purah"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hiHiUZF.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hiHiUZFm.jpg" alt="the Camera"/></a>
</figure>

With the Camera, Link basically has a smartphone. The applications for the
Camera in-game seem really cool though. By taking pictures of objects, they'll
be added to the Hyrule Compendium. The Compendium is *massive*, and has pages of
animals, monsters, and all sorts of things to take pictures of and fill the
Compendium. For some reason, that alone seems like a fun completion task to me,
maybe because it reminds me of the Pictograph and Figurine mechanics from Wind
Waker. But adding an item to the Compendium has a practical use as well. You can
set your Sheikah Sensor to track any object you've added to your Compendium, and
it will let you know when that item is nearby. I haven't tried this yet, but it
sounds pretty useful!

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oR7rEIS.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oR7rEISm.jpg" alt="taking pictures of objects"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LkCVJ0T.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LkCVJ0Tm.jpg" alt="monsters"/></a>
</figure>

After getting the Camera, I followed an old man in Kakariko and he pointed me to
the direction of the nearby Great Fairy Fountain, where I revived a Great Fairy
by giving her 100 rupees. They went with slightly different design for the Great
Fairies in Breath of the Wild from what I've seen in the series before. The
Great Fairy I found can enhance your equipment if you give her a few raw
materials, increasing its armor value. It was definitely worth seeking her out!

<figure class="half">

</figure>

That about sums about my adventure in Hyrule so far, but there are a few final
random notes I want to share. I love that Beedle is in this game, seeing him
again is really making me feel nostalgia for The Wind Waker! With the open
world, you can really get into situations that you are vastly under prepared
for, leading to death as you get trampled by a Bokoblin on horseback. I love it!
Lastly, Blood Moons are super metal. I only saw one this week, but as it began,
the light began to turn red, and ember-like particles filled the air. At the
time, I had just started some grass on fire in Hateno Village, and I was worried
that the changes were due to it spreading into a wildfire or something. But
nope, just a Blood Moon!

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tlJQAZ6.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tlJQAZ6m.jpg" alt="Blood Moons are super metal"/></a>
</figure>

That's all I have to say about Breath of the Wild for now. There's so many
things to do in this version of Hyrule, and so many possibilities within the
gameplay and combat, it's just amazing. I'm really looking forward to playing
more!
