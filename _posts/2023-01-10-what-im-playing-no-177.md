### The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD *(Wii U)*    {#TheLegendofZelda:TheWindWakerHD}

I still think of this HD version of Wind Waker as a new game, but it came out in
2013 so it's actually almost 10 years old as of the writing of this post...wow.

When Wind Waker HD came out, I didn't own a Wii U, so I missed out on it
completely. Now nearly 10 years later, I still don't own a Wii U, but after
after watching a Wind Waker randomizer video, I got the itch to play it again.
So, of course I thought about just playing through the GameCube version again.
It's the version I grew up with, it's familiar. But after a little Googling and
asking my Wii U owning friend about the differences between the two version, I
decided it was time to play through Wind Waker HD for the first time.

I was always a bit skeptical of the visual changes made in this version. The
GameCube original has such a timeless, iconic look, and I think it still holds
up. But playing Wind Waker HD, it really does look great. I still missed the
original graphics sometimes, but I ended up liking the HD visuals too. In terms
of gameplay tweaks, HD is *so* much nicer to play. Updated grappling hook
controls allowing you to change direction without stopping first, streamlined
PictoBox DX acquisition and figurine crafting, the list goes on and on, but
there's one thing that's probably the #1 improvement for a lot of people: the
Swift Sail. It's an optional item that was added to the auction on Windfall
Island, and once you get it you can toggle Fast Sailing by pressing A whenever
you're at sea. Fast Sailing is about twice as fast as regular sailing, and it
automatically sets the wind direction at your back, making sailing so much more
streamlined. I can see how some purists might scoff at this idea, and I myself
find the default sailing speed incredibly relaxing at times, but the thing is
that the Swift Sail is optional. If you don't like it, you don't even have to
pick it up! Or, you can just keep playing GameCube Wind Waker.

I forgot how much of a little gremlin Link is in this game. He makes the
funniest facial expressions, it's great. This has easily got to be the funniest
Zelda game thanks to this little guy. But aside from Link, the other characters
are really memorable too. The Rito and Korok races are very distinctive, and the
character designs in general for the human characters stay stuck in your mind
too. I might not know that snot-nosed kid's name from Outset Island, but I will
never forget him.

Prior to this, the last Zelda game I'd been playing was Ocarina of Time, so
adjusting to Wind Waker's combat again was a little jarring. I kept trying to
power crouch stab everything, but that's not a thing in Wind Waker. I like Wind
Waker's combat though. It feels much more cinematic than Ocarina of Time's with
the way the musical stings come in when you hit an enemy, and the dramatic
counterattack animations. The bosses in Wind Waker are incredible spectacles
too, the way they tower over Link is really cool.

The dungeons in Wind Waker are pretty good. I don't think they're the best in
the series, but they're well-designed and it was fun going through them all
again. I definitely remember the first three the most clearly, I must've played
through those a bunch of times as a kid and then started a new save file or
something. Those first two are definitely my favorites, there's just something
about them that I can't quite put my finger on. I do like how all the dungeons
in this game require Big Keys, especially when your path through the dungeon
takes you past the Boss Door before you get the Big Key, like in Dragon Roost
Cavern. I love it when the dungeons are designed to loop you back around like
that, it scratches the metroidvania-loving part of my brain.

I didn't plan on doing many side quests, and for the most part I didn't do a lot
of side stuff here. But I was surprised at a few of the side objectives I
completed simply because it had been so long since I played Wind Waker and did
those things, and I wanted to complete them and see if they were more
streamlined in the HD version. As a kid, I thought watering all the Korok
saplings was a *nightmare*. I'm pretty sure I did it like once, or maybe I never
even finished it because I didn't have a guide and couldn't find the last one.
I'm not sure, but this time I had seen several of the Koroks as I sailed around
the seas, and after a trip to Forest Haven to make some figurines (which is one
of my favorite things in the game, by the way), I was like "eh, I'm here, might
as well grab some Forest Water and go for it." This time I used a guide for the
Korok locations, and I'm glad I did or I never would've found some of the Koroks
in time. The combination of the Swift Sail and the increased Forest Water time
limit (from 20 minutes in the original to 30 minutes in HD) made finishing this
side quest completely painless, but it is pretty annoying that the only reward
you get for finishing this pretty involved, *timed* side quest that takes you
all over the world map is...a Heart Piece.

Playing through the Wind Waker for the first time in so long was a wonderful
experience packed with nostalgia. The original is one of the games I grew up
with, so it holds a special place in my heart. Even after all these years, Wind
Waker holds up extremely well, especially the HD version. It's not a difficult
game by any stretch of the imagination, but that's okay. It's a *fun* game, with
a sense of adventure in sailing its wide open seas that feels unique to the
series, with the exception of maybe Phantom Hourglass on the DS. It's been a
long time since I played that game too, but I don't think it captures quite the
same feeling as its home console predecessor. If you've never played The Wind
Waker, I definitely recommend giving it a try. Original or HD, I don't think you
can go wrong, but the quality-of-life improvements in HD go a long way. My final
time was 17 hours, 30 minutes.
