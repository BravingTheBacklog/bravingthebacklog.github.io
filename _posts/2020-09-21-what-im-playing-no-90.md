Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Blasphemous *(PC)*    {#Blasphemous}

This week I played through Blasphemous, a metroidvania that is similar to Hollow
Knight in some ways, but definitely has its own identity and a very different
tone.

Blasphemous is very grim. The game draws heavily from religion and gothic art
for aesthetic, with dialogue that sounds very biblical, and enemies and
characters that look very much like damned, suffering souls. It takes place in a
land called Cvstodia, and I have no idea how that's pronounced. Cvstodia is
affected by something known as The Miracle, and it blesses and curses the
residents of Cvstodia in incomprehensible ways. Few people remain in Cvstodia.
Many have been transformed into various beasts by The Miracle, and these beasts
are your primary foes when you explore the land as a warrior known as the
Penitant One. Very early in the game, Blasphemous gives you a good idea of
what kinds of sights await you, as after the first boss battle there's a
cutscene where the Penitant One removes his helmet, fills it with blood spilling
from his slain foe, and places it back on his head. Blood drips down from the
helmet, and you get an idea of the sort of experience Blasphemous will be.

After that gruesome sight, the game quickly opens up into a non-linear,
exploration-driven adventure. The game is structured into chunks, where you'll
have to complete several areas in order to progress to the next set of areas.
It's designed in such a way that you're able to explore any of the available
areas in any order. You're not funneled into exploring certain areas first by
needing to acquire abilities like double jump or wall jumping like in many
metroidvanias. Instead, you start out with quite a few abilities right away,
like dashing, and climbing walls by stabbing your sword into them. There are
some abilities you get later on that allow you to explore new areas, but a lot
of these areas are optional, and you can choose to ignore them if you don't want
to backtrack to acquire their optional collectibles. That said, there still is
quite a bit of backtracking - this *is* a metroidvania after all - but the map
is designed exceptionally well, looping back on itself and allowing you to
unlock shortcuts after your first visit to an area. This made exploring really
fun, as it allowed for many possible routes to get where you needed to go,
making the journey that much more interesting. I really like how the map screen
is presented as a traditional grid-based map too.

There are some very difficult boss fights in this game. In general, the game got
easier as I progressed. Though I died a lot early to some of the enemies and
platforming challenges, as I found more health and weapon upgrades I could
breeze through areas without much trouble, and without dying. The boss fights
were another story. All of these were pretty tough, and I died at least once in
nearly all of them. Some of them had me cursing out loud as I died again and
again after numerous attempts. The enemies you fight are usually hideously
deformed creatures, and the bosses are no exception to this. Many of them are
horribly twisted, and varying levels of disturbing.

Not all of the visuals are twisted and disturbing though. There are some really
beautiful pixel art backgrounds interspersed throughout the experience. Don't
get me wrong, all of the pixel art is wonderfully done, even the grotesque
stuff, but I found it easier to appreciate the gorgeous vistas than the bloodied
and mutilated enemies.

I touched on it earlier, but there are a ton of objects to collect. Spells,
rosary beads, sword attachments, quest items, relics, and the bones of various
deceased people...all of these and more are spread through the map, so there's
definitely no shortage of reasons to explore every nook and cranny. This and all
of what I've said before make Blasphemous a very compelling game, and a stunning
metroidvania. It has multiple endings, and first I got the "Bad Ending." I
couldn't help but keep playing after that, because it was just so much fun. I
used a guide to figure out the steps needed, but I quickly got everything I
needed for the true ending, and got that ending on my save file too. Blasphemous
definitely has my recommendation if it sounds at all interesting to you!

### Super Mario 64 *(Switch)*    {#SuperMario64}

Super Mario 3D All-Stars released this week, and I picked up a copy. The
collection consists of Super Mario 64, Sunshine, and Galaxy, and my plan is to
play through them chronologically. So, I started with Super Mario 64!

<figure class="third">

</figure>

I'd played bits and pieces of Super Mario 64 before, in its original N64 North
American release. This was rentals though. For some reason, I never owned Super
Mario 64 on N64, but I did convince my parents to let me rent it from a movie
rental store several times. Since saves were stored on the cartridge itself, and
there was no guarantee you'd get the same cartridge with each rental, each time
I rented the game I basically either had to start over or jump into someone
else's existing save on the cartridge. Because of this, I never finished Super
Mario 64 as a kid, but several of the worlds were quite familiar to me -
especially the first one, Bob-Omb Battlefield.

</figure>

I've played 3D Mario games before, so the first few worlds were easy as pie.
From the middle of the game and onwards though, the worlds definitely gave me
more trouble. Some of the Power Stars are tough to get! I think part of the
issue is that Mario's movement in this game feels significantly different than I
remember in Sunshine and later 3D Marios. Once Mario gets moving, it takes
longer to come to a stop than I expected, but I did learn to adjust for this a
bit as I played through. I also struggled with the camera quite a bit in some
instances. Considering that this is one of the earliest 3D games with a camera
like this, it's understandable that there's room for improvement, but it
definitely made me appreciate later 3D video game camera systems.

Currently, I haven't gotten more than the minimum 70 Stars required to enter the
final Bowser fight and beat the game. Once I had those 70, I went straight to
Bowser, kicked his tail, and rescued Princess Peach. I'll probably go back to my
save and try to get a few more Power Stars eventually, kind of like how I
sometimes play a bit of Super Mario Odyssey and try to get a few more Power
Moons here and there. The 3D Mario platformers are really nice to revisit like
that. As far as my thoughts on this Super Mario 3D All-Stars version of Super
Mario 64 specifically, I don't really have any complaints. It'd be nice if the
game rendered fullscreen, instead of in a little window in the center of the
screen, or even better, if it had options to configure these things. One thing I
liked about this version is that some 2D sprites were high-res, like the UI
elements for Star and coin counters. That's about it I think. Super Mario 64
still holds up quite well, and was fun to play through!
