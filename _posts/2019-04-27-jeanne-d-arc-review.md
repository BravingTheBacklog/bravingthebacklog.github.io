Jeanne d'Arc is a strategy RPG (SRPG) developed by Level-5 for the PSP. It
released in North America on August 21, 2007. Despite being Level-5's first game
developed for the PSP, and their first (and only) strategy game, it released to
favorable reviews and strong sales.

I'm used to SRPGs like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. I found
Jeanne d'Arc held up very well among this group.

## The Hundred Years' War, with demons

The story of Jeanne d'Arc deftly weaves in bits of actual history with fantastic
and magical elements. With Joan of Arc's involvement in The Hundred Years' War
as the basis, the story follows young Jeanne, a peasant girl from the small
village of Domrémy during the ongoing war. One night, Jeanne finds a magical
armlet in the forest. After it attaches itself to her wrist, she begins hearing
a voice telling her to fight to save France, and the armlet gives her the power
to transform into a powerful warrior. Immediately afterward, the English and
their monster minions attack and burn her village to the ground. Driven onward
by the voice in her head, and wanting to protect her friends and country, Jeanne
leaves the ruined Domrémy with her friends Roger and Liane to fight alongside
the French army.

This marks the beginning of her journey to save France from the English and the
demons they've allied with. A journey wrought with struggle and loss, but also
with a delightful cast of characters who join to fight at Jeanne's side. One of
these, La Hire, the lion-like therion, is based on the historical figure of the
same name. The La Hire in reality is also said to have been a close ally of Joan
of Arc. It's little historical touches like this that give the story of Jeanne
d'Arc an extra dimension that I haven't seen very often, at least not this
recognizably.

The game uses Anime cutscenes to portray key story moments throughout.
Considering the small resolution of the PSP, these look wonderful. There are
some dodgy frames of animation here and there, where maybe a character's face is
misshapen, but overall the quality is excellent. If a Jeanne d'Arc anime
adaptation was ever released, I would watch it immediately.

## Strategy RPG gameplay

Like other games in its genre, the primary gameplay element in Jeanne d'Arc is
strategic combat. Each stage has a victory condition and a failure condition.
Every stage also has a turn limit, so you can't waste too many turns. The turn
limit was only an issue in a few stages though, in general it was generous
enough not to feel restrictive, and kept me focused on the goal.

<figure class="half">

Through battle, your units gain experience and level up to become stronger. You
also need to manage their equipment by buying new weapons and armor from shops
throughout the game. This is pretty typical SRPG fare, but where Jeanne d'Arc
primarily innovates is with the Burning Aura and Transformation systems.

Burning Auras form when you land a regular attack on an enemy. The Burning
Aura forms on the opposite side of the enemy. If you place a character inside a
Burning Aura, their attacks will do more damage, providing incentive to surround
enemies. In my experience, Burning Aura made a huge difference against some
bosses, and throughout the entire game it felt like a very natural and well
thought out system.

The Transformation action available to some characters likewise revolutionizes
the strategic opportunities available to the player. Certain characters, like
Jeanne, can Transform once they've accrued enough SP. They gain 1 SP per turn,
and using the Transform ability takes 3 or 4 SP. Once transformed, the
characters become more powerful than when in their base forms, and gain access
to powerful skills unique to their transformed state. Throughout the game, you
will get additional gem stones for the armlet, which allow you to take on more
forms and use Transform more than once per stage.

</figure>

I also found the Godspeed mechanic while transformed very useful at times. If a
transformed character defeats an enemy, they get to act again. If you're able to
defeat another enemy in this time, the character again gets another move, and
the cycle continues. This opens the door for a lot of potential strategies when
facing many enemies at a time, and can turn the tide in a pinch!

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AQQ0Sl8.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AQQ0Sl8m.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

Of course, there are some problems Godspeed can't solve, and one of those is
boss battles.

## The struggle is real, sometimes

The biggest fault I found with Jeanne d'Arc is that it occasionally throws a
really tough difficulty spike at you. One minutes you're breezing through
missions without any problems, when a tricky stage or a seemingly god-like boss
stops you in your tracks.

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CUimAmP.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CUimAmPm.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

These difficulty spikes were the biggest struggle. *Most* of them seemed like a
fair enough challenge, and I was willing to lose a few times. At two points in
the second half of the game, there were *incredibly* difficult boss battles, and
I nearly lost motivation to complete the game.

Both times, however, I just looked up threads on GameFAQs to find suggestions on
how to best tackle those obstacles. Each time, a number of people didn't run
into the problems I did at all, which surprised me! The reason behind this boils
down to one thing: you can grind experience and levels freely before proceeding
to the next main story stage.

In SRPGs where grinding is possible, it often seems that an easy solution to a
difficult level, or even to a difficult game, is to just grind and increase the
levels of your units. This is definitely true for Jeanne d'Arc, and since I did
very little grinding in my playthrough, it may explain why I had such a hard
time on a few occasions.

Aside from the difficulty spikes, I can find very little fault with anything in
the game. Everything works and plays well. There are some features that would
have been nice to have, like the ability to speed up or skip battle animations,
or the ability to see the full attack range of the enemy.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/0lm5kCcm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/0lm5kCc.jpg)

For the latter, Jeanne d'Arc does allow you to see an individual enemy's
movement and direct attack range, however it does not show you the attack range
of any special skills they might have. So an enemy who has a powerful magic
spell might not *look* like they can hit you based on their movement range, but
they might still be able to throw a spell your way. You also can't turn on
movement/attack range visibility while planning your own moves, or for more than
one enemy at a time. Fire Emblem has all these nice features, so maybe I'm just
spoiled from playing those. On the other hand, Jeanne d'Arc probably doesn't
need those attack and movement range features since unit death isn't permanent
as it is in Fire Emblem.

## Save France, Jeanne!

There are a number of fun mechanics in Jeanne d'Arc I didn't even cover in this
review. It's not that I skipped over them because they're bad features, far from
it. Things like Skill Gems, Skill Binding, Skill Affinities, and Unified Guard.
These features too make Jeanne d'Arc a great game, and Skills in particular
allow for lots of great customization and freedom. Other RPGs or SRPGs have
similar features though, and I only wanted to cover the unique aspects of Jeanne
d'Arc in depth.

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6GjU8gi.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6GjU8gim.png"/></a>
</figure>

In the end, my recommendation on Jeanne d'Arc is this: for fans of SRPGs, if you
are able to play it you absolutely should! I also think that it would be a
decent entry to the SRPG genre, thanks to the early game tutorials that explain
many concepts well, but should a new player run into difficulty spikes (which
they may not, depending on their playstyle) they may be discouraged.
