Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

My writeup on Ni no Kuni is free of plot spoilers (other than the first hour or
so of the game, which a the Steam store page also covers), but there are
screenshots of party members and abilities you get mid-way through the game, so
if that sounds like anything you don't want spoiled, you should probably skip
this post!

### Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Remastered *(PC)*    {#NinoKuni:WrathoftheWhiteWitchRemastered}

I started this JRPG this week. One of the notable features here are the animated
cutscenes produced by Studio Ghibli, as well as music from Joe Hisaishi, who has
often composed music for Studio Ghibli films. After losing his mother in a
tragic accident, young Oliver meets Mr. Drippy, a fairy who tells Oliver he's
the Pure Hearted One, which means he's the only one who can save the magical
world Mr. Drippy came from. In his grief, Oliver is at first ambivalent about
the fate of the other world, but when Mr. Drippy tells him that there may still
be a way to save his mother, he agrees to help, and together the pair travel to
the other world.

In the other world, Oliver begins learning magic in order to become a wizard and
defeat the Dark Djinn, Shadar, who's been terrorizing people the world over. One
of the first spells you'll learn is Form Familiar, which allows you to summon
familiars to fight for you in battle, but you learn a whole slew of other
spells, both for use in and out of combat. A lot of them you'll only be able to
use in a few specific spots to open up a new path or something, but I enjoy
having a lot of spells in the spellbook anyway.

On the topic of the battle system, it's a blend of tactical and real-time
action. You control either Oliver (or another party member once you get them) or
one of his familiars, and can move freely around the battlefield in real-time.
Changing your target, controlled character, or selecting an item or spell from
the menu pauses the action, but otherwise time keeps moving, so it's a very
lively system. Once you choose an attack action, your character automatically
moves in range of the target and launches the attack. There's a short cooldown
period for actions, during which you can run around to dodge attacks, use a
different skill, or defend. Most of the time, I treat it like a pure action RPG,
and just run in and attack wildly. That doesn't always work very well. With some
enemies, especially bosses, you need to take your time, defend when they launch
a strong attack, look for counterattack opportunities, and switch to Oliver to
cast spells or use items when needed. Your familiars have stamina and can only
stay out for so long before you need to switch to Oliver or a different familiar
to let the original one's stamina recover, and that's another element that keeps
battles interesting.

Outside of battle, you'll spend your time exploring new towns, taking on small
errands, feeding your familiars treats to give them small permanent stat boosts,
and exploring dungeons. There's also a world map. Pretty much all your standard
JRPG elements, and it all feels very cozy.

Another common gameplay element, used to complete errands or advance the main
story from time to time, is finding people with an excess of emotions, and
borrowing some of this with the Take Heart spell. You can then use this bottled
emotion to cure someone Shadar cursed with Broken Heartedness, casting Give
Heart and giving them the bit of whatever emotion they're lacking. It's a pretty
straightforward task, since the dialogue will tell you exactly what emotion a
Broken Hearted person needs, but what makes it interesting is that you can only
carry 1 of each emotion type at once. This means you might have to backtrack if
you want to complete all side quests, but you get a Travel spell later on that
allows you to teleport to any city or dungeon you've previously visited, which
makes the backtracking much easier since you don't need to run all over the
world map through low level enemy encounters.

There's a monster catching mechanic you unlock eventually too, where you'll be
able to tame defeated enemies sometimes, and make them your familiars to use in
future battles. Defeated enemies will sometimes get back up and have a heart
above their head, which is your cue to switch to the party member who can tame
them and Serenade them for a bit. As long as you do this fast enough, it seems
like the taming will always succeed. At least, I haven't seen it fail yet. Once
recruited, the enemy can be used like any other familiar, fighting for you in
battle, and leveling up. You can only have so many familiars travelling with you
at a time, but any extras can be stored in the Familiar Retreat for withdrawal
later. They can metamorphose when they reach a certain level and you feed them a
specific item too. As far as the monster designs themselves, most aren't
particularly memorable, once I finish the game I probably won't remember what
most of them look like. Many have somewhat amusing puns in their names though,
like a ghost creature called the Girlfiend. It metamorphoses in the
Ex-Girlfiend, which I found pretty amusing.

I'm finding a lot to like about Ni no Kuni. The monster raising mechanic is fun,
albeit pretty basic, the battle system is an interesting blend of mechanics, and
the cel-shaded graphics and character designs look great, and just ooze charm.
The story's opening really resonated with me too, it was pretty emotional and
felt like a condensed Studio Ghibli film. There haven't really been emotional
moments like that since then, but I'm still enjoying the story. It's an innocent
romp through a fantastic, magical world, and I can't help but feel a sort of
child-like sense of wonder whenever there's a new city or animated cutscene.
It's a really enjoyable JRPG, if you're a fan of the genre I definitely
recommend giving it a try!
