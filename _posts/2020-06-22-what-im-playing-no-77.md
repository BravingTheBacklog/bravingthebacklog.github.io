Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

This post is free of main story spoilers for Persona 4 Golden. I cover some of
the slice of life situations, so if you want those to remain a surprise you
might consider skipping that section this week!

### The Sims 4 *(PC)*    {#TheSims4}

I played just a *tiny* bit of The Sims 4 this week because I wanted to check out
the newest expansion pack, Eco Lifestyle. This pack is all about green living.
Every neighborhood of every world has a new eco-friendliness meter that is
influenced by each lot in the neighborhood. If the lots contain lots of items
that are "green," then the meter gradually advances to the green side. On the
other hand, if the lots contain lots of industrial items, the meter advances to
the industrial side over time. Admittedly, I didn't play long enough to see the
impact of these new gameplay elements. There's things like solar panels, rain
collectors, bug farms, and many other new items as well.

To celebrate the new pack, I moved Kaleigh Covarrubias and her roommates,
Celeste and Bret, to a lot in the new world. I moved them to a neighborhood that
was initially on the industrial side of the meter. The whole neighborhood had a
sickly brown palor when they moved in. I initially tried to build a house myself
but I gave up after probably close to an hour and just replaced everything I'd
built with this cool house from the gallery. Also, the last time I'd played the
Sims was to have Kaleigh finish her degree at university, so she was still in
her graduation cap and gown when they moved.

I did make one addition to the house. I built a small underground room for Bret,
and put the ladder to enter it over by the dumpster. For a while I had the doors
locked such that Bret could only go into his underground chamber, but I let him
back into the main house to make it easier for him to keep his Social need
filled. He started a fire in the house at one point though, so I had my reasons
for exiling him to his dungeon.

Not much else happened. I had Kaleigh try out some of the new items, like the
fizzing machine that you can use to create fizzy drinks out of fruits and other
items from your inventory. Then she got to know the neighbors by drinking their
blood, and started a new career as a sous chef. Just your everyday Sims things,
you know?

### Persona 4 Golden *(PC)*    {#Persona4Golden}

I made quite a bit more progress this week, but I won't go into much detail to
avoid spoiling anything. I've maxed out quite a few social links, but there are
some others that I barely started this week.

One part of Persona 4 Golden I really like is the school trip to Tatsumi Port
Island, the fictional city from Persona 3. It's just dripping with P3 nostalgia
and I love it! Music from Persona 3 plays during that section, and the
characters visit locations from P3. There's also a reference to another Shin
Megami Tensei spinoff, Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha and the Soulless Army. I
don't think I noticed that reference the first time I played P4G.

I'm still really enjoying my playthrough! There are so many charming scenes with
the cast just hanging out together. Many of these get me laughing or at least
chuckling out loud. This is such a loveable cast! And of course the battle
system is excellent too!
