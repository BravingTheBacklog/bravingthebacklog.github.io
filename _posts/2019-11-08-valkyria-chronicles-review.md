In 2008, Sega released Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3 to great critical
reception. In 2014, it came to PC, releasing on Steam. That's the version I
picked up, and though it sat in my Steam backlog for years, I finally gave it a
try! Here's my spoiler-free review of Valkyria Chronicles, a delightful strategy
RPG.

## The Art of War

Gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles has you commanding soldiers in tactical,
turn-based battles.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/S9uFlGu.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/S9uFlGum.jpg"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0AybVL3.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0AybVL3m.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

The soldiers under your command will be one of six different unit classes:
Scouts, Shocktroopers, Lancers, Engineers, Snipers, and Tanks. Each class has
its own strengths and weaknesses, and general serves a unique purpose. Scouts,
for example, can move very far in a single action, and have good range with
their rifles, but are relatively fragile in direct combat.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pzFOGes.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pzFOGesm.jpg"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NzHefIa.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NzHefIam.jpg"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HzFCdPk.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HzFCdPkm.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

One nice feature is that rather than having your units level up individually,
your unit classes level up instead. When your Scout class reaches level 5, for
instance, every Scout unit in your squad will be level 5. You spend the
experience points earned from battles to level up each unit class. Once they
have enough experience, the class levels ups, and all units of that class gain
the benefits. This is nice because it removes any need to grind experience to
evenly level up your team, and ensures you never have weak, underleveled units.
Unless you've been deliberately neglecting an entire unit class, of course!

<figure class="half">

### The Flow of Battle

At the start of your turn in battle, you're given a number of Command Points
(CP). Controlling a unit and having them act in battle costs CP. Each action
consists of moving and attacking once with one unit.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GYu7nIQ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GYu7nIQm.jpg"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/syeFutj.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/syeFutjm.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

While controlling a unit, you can move them freely, in real time. As a unit
moves, they'll expend Action Points (AP) from their total AP. This effectively
controls how far they can possibly move during a single action, though you can
end their action before they run out of AP if you want. You can also control the
same unit multiple times per turn, as long as you have CP remaining. Each
successive action that units takes results in them having less total AP
available.

Aside from moving, you can also enter targeting mode during a unit's action, to
plan and deliver an attack. Targeting mode allows you to aim freely, and shows a
reticle where shots will land based on the accuracy of the character and their
weapon. There's some randomness within the range of the reticle, but you at
least always know the shots will land somewhere within it.

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ocdKXZr.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ocdKXZrm.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

While in targeting mode, you can snap between visible enemy targets with the
push of a button. This is a great feature, and it can even remind you of an
enemy you forgot was there or didn't realize was in sight of your current unit!
Once you've picked your target and lined up your shot, you command your unit to
fire and they'll shoot one or more bullets/rounds at the enemy, depending on
unit class. Some unit classes also have grenades, which can be used in targeting
mode instead of their primary weapon, but these can be used only once per turn
due to limited ammo, unless the unit is resupplied by an Engineer after using
their stock of grenades.

There's incentive to fine tune the shot after snapping to a target. The auto-aim
will generally fire at the enemy's torso. But headshots deal more damage, so I
almost always stepped in and adjusted the shot manually, especially with Scouts,
to try and get that headshot damage multiplier. It really makes a big
difference, as a Scout will normally have to fire on a Shocktrooper several
times to take them down, whereas an attack that results in several headshots
could take a Shocktrooper down in one barrage!

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/aOFLjbm.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOFLjbmm.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

After your unit fires in targeting mode, their target will launch a
counterattack, provided they have a weapon with unlimited ammo and your unit is
within their range. This means that Lancers and Snipers will never counterattack
because their weapons have limited ammo supplies, unlike the rifles and machine
guns of the other unit classes. Of course, enemy units can't counterattack if
they were defeated by your initial attack, so that's another reason to make each
shot count!

You can also have a character use Ragnaid to heal themselves or a nearby ally
during targeting mode. This uses up their chance to attack during that action,
but sometimes it's better to have a unit heal up and bide their time than rush
in for another attack.

One thing to watch out for while moving a unit is interception fire. When you're
in an enemy's line of sight, and within range or their gunfire, they will
automatically fire upon you. This is called interception fire. If you're not
careful, this can really bite into your units' health, especially less sturdy
units like Scouts and Engineers. Note that the enemy will stop firing on your
once you enter interception mode, giving you plenty of time to pick your target.
It's also important that just like with counterattacks, Lancers and Snipers
cannot deliver interception fire due to their limited ammo. Also, approaching
the enemy from behind is generally recommended, since you can avoid stepping
into their sight line and thus avoid the possibility of interception fire. Plus,
if you hit an enemy from behind, they will become panicked, reducing the
accuracy of their counterattack. Interception fire works in your favor on the
enemy's turn too. Having my own units automatically gun down enemies when they
approached too recklessly was *very* satisfying.

Once you've used all your available CP, your turn is over. You can also end your
turn before using all your available CP. Any unused CP is rolled over to use on
your next turn, so there is some strategic weight to taking few or no actions on
a turn as it means you'll have more CP to used at the start of your next turn.

### Camp Your Way to Victory

While some missions are won by defeating all enemies, or some other condition,
many of the missions in the main story are won by capturing the enemy's base
camp. On the flip side, if the enemy captures your base camp, it's Game Over for
you!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/105FH9E.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/105FH9Em.jpg"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SKS61f9.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SKS61f9m.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

To capture a camp, it first must have no enemy occupants. You can do this the
normal way, by simply defeating all the enemies within the camp...or you can
cheese your way to capturing the camp by sending in a Scout on a potential
suicide mission. Have them throw a grenade into the camp, the blast of which
knocks the enemies *just* outside the camp, then have the Scout sprint in and
capture the camp. I did this at least once, and it was both satisfying and
hilarious that it worked!



Camps, base and otherwise, have a number of benefits. Units within the
boundaries of a camp have increased stats, allowing them to more easily defend
it from enemies. You can have units retreat into the reserves from a camp,
leaving the battlefield and freeing a slot for reinforcements. Reinforcements
are called to a camp, and cost 1 CP to call. They'll arrive on the next turn and
be ready for battle. On large maps, it's sometimes a good idea to have units
with low AP retreat from your base camp, and then call them as reinforcements at
a camp you've captured further in.

### The Cost of War

When one of your units runs out of HP on the battlefield, they become downed. A
downed unit is unable to move or attack, but still counts against your active
unit roster, so you can't call for reinforcements the minute someone is downed.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UiVRZ2C.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UiVRZ2Cm.jpg"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4UjQOA9.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4UjQOA9m.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

You can save a downed unit by simply reaching them with one of your other units.
This calls in the squad medic, who miraculously whisks them away and patches
their injuries. After a one turn delay, that unit can be called back to the
battlefield as a reinforcement. Such amazing recovery time!

If you are unable to reach a downed unit within three turns, or an enemy unit
reaches them first, that unit is removed from the battlefield. There are a few
units that will simply withdraw for the remainder of the mission, such as
Alicia, or Rosie. For the vast majority of units though, if you don't revive
them in time, they die in the line of duty, and are gone forever.

This permadeath system makes Valkyria Chronicles feel a bit like Fire Emblem. It
also distances it from other wartime strategy games like Advance Wars. Every one
of your soldiers is a unique character, with their own personality. In my
playthrough, I didn't have any units die for good. I got a few Game Overs along
the way though, and before I lost and retried the mission I saw a few units die,
and those deaths really hit me.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/X3FUewV.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/X3FUewVm.jpg"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wqrLLz4.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wqrLLz4m.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

I found the battle system mechanics to be *hugely* enjoyable, although it did
take me a while to figure out how to use all the concepts together effectively.
The difficulty does ramp up nicely though, and the concepts are explained very
well in-game. You can also save the game at any point during your turn in
battle, which was a really nice option to have. The pace of it all is very
interesting, as you jump back and forth from the relaxed tactical overview of
the battlefield to the sometimes intense direct control of your soldiers.

## On the Gallian Front

Valkyria Chronicles takes place in a fantasy world, in Europa. It's likely
inspired by Europe. The main conflict revolves around the in-game equivalent of
World War II, the Second Europan War. The story is told through the lens of a
narrator reading from a history book focused on the principality of Gallia's
role in the Second Europan War. I loved the "historical fantasy" sort of feeling
to this story and world, it felt really fresh. Plus, the visual style of the
game leans into the history book theme as well, with the graphics rendered in a
way that makes them like illustrations. I works well, and looks great!

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ksk5Jjw.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ksk5Jjwm.jpg"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FwraQFf.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FwraQFfm.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

The main story is progressed by completing story missions, with cutscenes in
between them. You can view the cutscenes at your own pace, with no single
cutscene taking very long. Some of the cutscenes are fully animated and
cinematic, while others are brief dialogue sequences.I enjoyed both kinds, and
was surprised at the amount of variety in the dialogue sequences.

The dialogue cutscenes use comic book style panels for the characters involved.
The panels usually just show the characters' heads, but in some instances pull
back and show a unique animation depending on the character and cutscene.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2J5MgxX.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2J5MgxXm.jpg"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/C21gw1f.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/C21gw1fm.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

The main plot is excellent, if a little slow to really get going. Once various
plot points begin to come together though, it picks up steam at an exhilarating
pace. Once I reached the latter half of the game, I found myself thinking of
these characters and story frequently, even when I wasn't playing the game. I
just had to see what became of all of them, and what would happen next!

The world building is expertly done too. Concepts like ragnite, the primary fuel
source of the world, are explained at a good pace. It never feels over your head
or too heavy-handed in its delivery. The history of Europa and its people are
also gradually detailed. Of course, if you forget any of the information relayed
in the story cutscenes, or simply want to read more, there's a glossary where
you can read more about a wide array of in-game terms and characters.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nuPZnkb.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nuPZnkbm.jpg"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gaSBA7C.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gaSBA7Cm.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

Of course, Europa wouldn't be very interesting without good characters. The main
cast of Valkyria Chronicles was very likable, and filled with human characters
with quirks and flaws. Additional backstory is available for each of the main
characters in the form of optional story chapters available later in the game,
and I can't recommend these enough. The optional missions added a lot to my love
of this cast. These characters are used to tell a very emotional and touching
story over the course of the game. Seriously, it knows how to hit you in the
feels, and when it hits you, *it hits hard*.

## Critiques and Final Thoughts

My biggest complaints come from the first half of my playthrough, when I was
still figuring things out.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/IXhY5Fom.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/IXhY5Fo.jpg)
{: .image-right }

For one, I was failing missions more frequently in the beginning. Sometimes I
would reach a point where I knew I had made horrible mistakes that I had no
chance of coming back from. In those cases, I really wish there had been a quick
option to restart the mission. There is a restart option, but only when you fail
the mission. If you have an earlier save, you can always reload that any time on
your turn, but early in the game I hadn't made a habit of creating lots of saves
yet. That's my fault though.

The early game is a little slow too, in terms of both plot and gameplay. Things
are happening in the story, but you don't really get a feel of where it's
leading until later, and I didn't really feel drawn in until that point.

But these grievances are really minor in the end. The experience as a whole is
extremely compelling. The mechanics and story are so enjoyable, I'm even
considering a second playthrough, or at least replaying some story mission in
New Game+. If you're a fan of strategy RPGs, definitely give Valkyria Chronicles
a try! Even if you haven't played any strategy games, this could be a very fun
place to start if you're willing to give it a try!
