Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Super Mario Sunshine *(Switch)*    {#SuperMarioSunshine}

Next up for me on the Super Mario 3D All-Stars collection: Super Mario Sunshine.
Unlike Super Mario 64, I owned, played, and finished Sunshine in its original
console release, so playing it on Switch was a nice walk down memory lane.

One thing I had kind of forgotten about is that Mario goes to jail during this
game, albeit briefly. The basis of the plot is that Mario and Peach go to Isle
Delfino for a vacation, and when they get there Mario is blamed for defacing the
island with goop. He's been framed by the enigmatic Shadow Mario, but the
authorities don't believe this and lock him up while awaiting his trial anyway.
At the trial, Mario is sentenced to clean up the entire island, which should
hopefully cause the island guardian's, the Shine Sprites, to return and bring
wonderful sunny days back to the inhabitants. Mario is equipped with FLUDD for
this task, a water-spraying backpack with several attachments including a
jetpack. FLUDD is the main gimmick here, and I really like the water-spraying
mechanic.

Presentation-wise, it's *so* nice having this game in widescreen. The UI
elements also look really crisp, so those (and likely other elements as well)
must have been swapped out for higher res versions. As a whole, the graphics
have held up quite well, even with some blurry textures. I had fewer issues with
the camera than in Super Mario 64, but sometimes I still had to fight it a
little. It definitely helps having the 2nd stick available to manually move the
camera with more precision.

Collecting Shines was a lot of fun most of the time, but the missions in
Sunshine are structured differently than in 64. In Super Mario 64, you could
collect Stars out-of-order if you wanted. In Sunshine, the missions in each
world are linear. In order to get the 2nd Shine, you first need to complete the
1st Shine mission before the 2nd one becomes available. You can still freely
move between the unlocked worlds, so there's still some freedom of choice.
Unfortunately though, there's no specific number of Shine Sprites you need to
finish the game. Instead, the final stage only appears after you've completed
the Shadow Mario mission in each world - usually the 7th mission. This made
getting to the ending feel like a chore to me. There were some missions in the
later worlds that I *really* wasn't enjoying, and I just wanted to skip
them...but I couldn't, since I needed to complete them to get to the required
Shadow Mario mission. The later worlds and Stars in Super Mario 64 were similar
in this regard, but unlike in Sunshine I could mostly ignore those worlds and
gather Stars from the levels I enjoyed more.

Aside from that, I really enjoyed replaying Sunshine. The FLUDD mechanics make
it very distinct from Super Mario 64, as well as the setting. I love Isle
Delfino and its tropical environments, and I think I prefer them to the less
cohesive worlds of Super Mario 64. All in all, Super Mario Sunshine holds up
quite well. It does some things better than its predecessor, and the reverse is
also true. I'm looking forward to playing Super Mario Galaxy soon. Many people
say Galaxy is the best 3D Mario platformer, and I remember really enjoying it in
its original Wii release, so I definitely have high expectations for it!

### 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim *(PS4)*    {#A13Sentinels:AegisRim}

This Vanillaware-developed game saw its international release this week, and I
had pre-ordered a copy because I really enjoyed the last Vanillaware game I
played, Odin Sphere Leifthrasir. The 2D visuals have the same wonderful style I
enjoyed so much in Odin Sphere, though the gameplay is *very* different. 13
Sentinels is comprised of 2 parts: visual novel segments, and strategic combat.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

The game's opening is linear, and introduces you to several of the game's *many*
characters, having you control them in succession, with each segment separated
by a tutorial battle that shows you the ropes of the combat system. Battles have
you controlling the same characters as the story segments, but now you're
controlling them as they pilot giant mechs called Sentinels, fighting against
giant invading machines called Deimos. Battles use a real-time with pause
system, where the actions pauses when you're deciding orders for a Sentinel.
After you choose an action, if it's an attack the Sentinel will execute it while
the action stays paused, and then the battle switches to real-time mode while
the Sentinel enters a cooldown phase for a few seconds before it can be given
orders again. The tutorial battles were very straightforward, but I can easily
see how they could become quite chaotic and challenging as the game progresses.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

After the tutorial/intro segment is done, things become a lot more non-linear.
You're able to pick from many of the characters' stories in the visual novel
gameplay mode, though some are locked until you've met certain conditions like
seeing an event in another character's story path, or clearing up to a certain
point in the combat mode. Also at this point, battles are no longer
automatically interspersed between visual novel segments. Instead, you can
choose whether you want to play the visual novel or battle modes. I found myself
gravitating toward the visual novel segments, since the tutorial left me way
more interested in all the characters, their relationships, and the overarching
plot being crafted. Like other visual novels, there are branching paths in the
story based on your actions, and that's always an enticing prospect! What's
interesting is that I *think* the battle segments all take place after the
events of the visual novel. The visual novel mode does an excellent job of
gradually answering questions you might have about the characters and their
relationships, and then it adds brand new mysteries on top of those to entice
you to experience more of the story. It's very well done, but that's not to say
the combat mode should be written off!

After I eventually tried the combat mode, I realized it was way more interesting
and fun than the tutorial battles made it out to be! For one, of the 13 Sentinel
pilots you have available, you have to assign them to either attacking or
defense, with a maximum of 6 attackers allowed per battle. A pilot can only
participate as an attacker in 2 consecutive battles before they become
overloaded, and need to rest before they can be used again as either an attacker
or defender. The more consecutive battles you fight, the higher your score will
get, but the fewer pilots you will have to work with since they will inevitably
become overloaded and need to rest. You can recover all your pilots immediately
by ending your battle streak, but then your score multiplier resets. It's an
unexpectedly arcade-like system of shooting for a high score, but it seems
pretty cool! On top of this, your pilots also gain experience when they're
attackers in battle, and level up. Also, you can upgrade your pilots' abilities
and purchase new skills for them, which adds further appeal to combat mode. As a
nice cherry on top, there are also *way* more enemies in each battle. All these
features that weren't revealed in the intro make combat way more exciting!

I'm really looking forward to diving further into both the story and combat next
week, as I still feel like I'm just scratching the surface of 13 Sentinels,
despite being nearly 6 hours in now! I realize I didn't cover the details of the
story much at all. It's rather involved, to say the least, and I'm still piecing
a lot of things together. I'll likely write more about the story's specifics in
a future post!
