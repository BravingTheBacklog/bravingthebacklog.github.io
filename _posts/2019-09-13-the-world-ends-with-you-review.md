The World Ends With You is an Action RPG for the Nintendo DS co-developed by
Square Enix and Jupiter, and released in North America on April 22nd, 2008.
Since then, it has been ported to mobile phones and had a remastered release on
the Nintendo Switch with extra content.

I played the original DS version, and I had such a great time with it! Read on
for my full, spoiler-free review!

## The Reaper's Game

Very early on, the story that the game's characters find themselves caught up in
grabbed my attention and pretty much never let go. There are just some
incredibly epic moments and reveals throughout the story. I *really* wish I
could say more, but in the interest of avoiding spoilers I'll just summarize the
initial setup of the plot.

Neku Sakuraba wakes up in Shibuya with no memory. None of the many passersby can
see or hear him either. He then receives a cryptic message on his phone, telling
him to reach 104 within 60 minutes, or he will be "erased" - signed, The
Reapers. Writing off as spam, he attempts to delete it unsuccessfully, but
doesn't have much time to process the strange message. A timer appears painfully
on his hand, counting down from 60 minutes. Strange, hostile creatures appear
before him and attack, forcing him to run. After barely outrunning them, he
meets a girl, Shiki Misaki. More of the monsters appear, and Shiki demands Neku
form a pact with her so they can fight off the Noise - the monsters. With no
other options, Neku agrees, and the pact gives the two the power to fight the
Noise using abilities called Psychs. They survive the battle, but the This is
just their first day in the week long Reaper's Game, where their fate and their
very lives are on the line. clock is still ticking - they've got to hurry to
104!

</figure>

That's the setup to the story, I really don't want to spoil *anything* because
figuring out what the details of the world and what was going on was so much fun
when I played it. I highly recommend going into the game without having any of
it spoiled for you.

The pacing of the story is excellent, and the end was really satisfying,
although I did have a few things I was confused about. Luckily, there's a bunch
of post-game content in the form of Secret Reports to collect that provide
further backstory on characters and the plot, and serve to fill in the gaps.
These aren't necessary to chase after. I still haven't pursued any of these
answers in the post-game, and I feel good about the ending as is. But it is nice
to know that the answers in the game somewhere.

## Awesome Soundtrack

The World Ends With You is a joy to listen to. Over the course of my
playthrough, I heard a few of the tracks a lot, and I never got sick of hearing
them. I've even listened to some tracks from the OST while working, or while
writing. It's just that good!

The soundtrack is full of hip-hop, rock, and electronic influences. This gives
it a very contemporary sound, which works incredibly well with the modern
setting. In that regard it reminds me of the Persona series a bit, and a few of
the tracks I imagine would fit in quite well in Persona 3 or 4.

A large number of the songs actually have lyrics too, which is especially
impressive given technical limitations of the DS. DS cartridges still had
relatively limited space, even when compared to Nintendo's followup handheld,
the 3DS. Music had to be compressed to save space, or else there wouldn't be
room on the cartridge for the other elements of the game. In fact, roughly a
quarter of The World Ends With You's data on the cartridge consists of music,
with over 30 tracks in-game.

## Fantastic Visuals

The story and music are backed up by a very striking and distinctive visual
style. The various Shibuya locations you explore throughout the game look great.
The way certain elements, like power lines, will appear in the foreground and
parallax scroll as you advance is executed perfectly. The backgrounds are often
filled with towering buildings, and plenty of NPCs wander the streets of the
Scramble, and a few other areas, bringing the bustling atmosphere to life.

Character designs are very unique and recognizable. Tetsuya Nomura is the man
responsible for these designs. He's also worked on the Kingdom Hearts and Final
Fantasy series, and I think some of the Kingdom Hearts work he did may have
influenced his work here, or maybe it's just part of his style. The character
sprites look great, and have some very expressive poses!

The dialogue boxes for conversations throughout the game remind me heavily of
comic book or manga dialogue. The way the edges of them are spiky during urgent
dialogue, or bubbly to represent a character's thoughts, works as well here as
it does in manga.

## It's a Wonderful Battle System

Describing The World Ends With You as an Action RPG is like describing a cake as
a baked good. It's accurate, but it leaves out so much. Battles use a real-time,
active system and take place on *both screens at once*.

On the bottom screen (the touch screen), you control Neku exclusively with the
stylus. You drag him around to have him run and dash around enemies to avoid
attacks, and have him attack back using various gestures depending on the Pins
he is wearing.

On the top screen, you have Neku's partner, Shiki. The top screen is controlled
with the D Pad or buttons, allowing the player to hold the stylus in either
hand. Pressing left or right causes the partner to attack enemies in that
direction. Enemies will warp from the left to right side on the top screen, so
you have to pay attention to avoid attacking empty space.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WcqHdrz.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WcqHdrzm.png"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UknHhPr.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UknHhPrm.png"/></a>
</figure>

A single HP pool is shared between Neku and Shiki. Additionally, the enemies you
face are basically "mirrored" on both screens as well. A frog enemy appearing on
the bottom screen, for instance, will also appear on the top screen, and has a
single HP value behind the scenes. It's really the same enemy, just existing
across both the bottom and top screen "zones." This is explained really well
in-game actually, but I'm finding it difficult to properly explain myself.

Furthermore, there's a Fusion attack that can be activated after earning enough
Fusion Stars through combat on the top screen. The way these Stars are earned
changes a few times over the course of the game, but initially it's basically a
game of matching/memory. You traverse Shiki's combo map to reach a card at the
end of it, and if that card matches the face-down card that the cursor is
pointing to at the top of the screen, it's flipped. If it doesn't match, you'll
see where that card fits in the sequence, and will be able to use that knowledge
to match that card when the cursor is pointing to that spot. Once 3 cards are
matched, a Fusion Star is gained, and you can initiate a powerful Fusion attack
that also restores some HP.

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GJoC0GK.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GJoC0GKm.png"/></a>
</figure>

With all the different parts of combat between the top and bottom screen, it may
seem like a lot to take in. It's paced really well though, you aren't expected
to pick everything up at once. There's also the extremely helpful auto-battle
options for the top screen, where you can let the AI control the top screen
entirely if you leave it inactive for a the specified number of settings. I
ended up falling back on that option quite a bit, but still manually took
control sometimes. It's definitely a valid way to play if you're not coordinated
enough to play both screens all the time, and I was very grateful for the option
when things got really hectic in battle!

In fact, the player is given an incredible depth of choice when it comes to
difficulty. Aside from boss battles and a mandatory scripted enemy encounters,
you choose when you want to fight enemies. You don't need to grind for levels or
experience unless you want to. You can also choose to fight more enemies in a
row to improve your item drops.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/bMfGYo1m.png)](https://i.imgur.com/bMfGYo1.png)
{: .image-right }

Additionally, the difficulty level can be changed at any time, between Normal
and Easy mode once Easy is unlocked, which happens pretty early on. There's also
a Hard difficulty, but you unlock that by finishing the main story. Prior to
unlocking other difficulty levels, you can also reduce your level if you want a
greater challenge. There's a slider for this in the menu you can adjust between
battles, from 1 to whatever your current max level is. At lower levels you have
less HP, so battles require more precision.

Playing on higher difficulties, lowering your player level, and fighting higher
numbers of enemies in a row, all contribute to getting better drops from
enemies. There's definitely a lot of reward here for players who want to test
their skills.

### Pins & Psychs

[![](https://i.imgur.com/3zhRAxtm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/3zhRAxt.png)
{: .image-right }

I mentioned Pins a bit earlier. Pins allow Neku to use Psychs, which serve as
your attacks in battle, and also function as a collectible where you can track
the percentage of Pins in the game that you have mastered and have in your
inventory. Collecting them like that is completely optional though. I didn't
hold onto my weaker Pins during my playthrough, and just sold them since they
served little purpose once I had access to stronger Pins.

Each Pin lets Neku use a specific Psych, with various gestures required to
activate them in battle. Some require you to tap screen, or drag over empty
space, or slash at enemies. In the beginning of the game, Neku can wear 2 Pins
into battle at a time, but you can increase this up to 6 over the course of the
game.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/A1aiigT.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/A1aiigTm.png"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BjKUvZy.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BjKUvZym.png"/></a>
</figure>

The Pins you wear into battle gain Pin Points (PP), and many of them level up
once they've gained enough PP. Leveling up Pins increases their strength, and
certain Pins even evolve into new Pins once they reach a high enough level.
Every Pin has a max level, and once it reaches that level it is mastered, and
will increased your Pin Mastery % stat on your save file as long as you keep it
in your inventory.

Oh, and you also gain PP when loading your save based on how long it's been
since you last played. This is sort of a random feature, but it was actually
really nice to see when I would boot up the game after having been away from it
for an entire work day, for example! It's a nice little bonus.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YiZuJTy.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YiZuJTym.png"/></a>
</figure>

Pins also have a brand associated with them. Based on the game's trend system,
certain brands may receive bonuses or penalties during battle based on whether
that brand is popular or not in the current area. You can actually influence the
trends yourself by wearing Pins of a certain brand into battle.

Like other RPGs, there's also an equipment system where each character can be
equipped with 4 pieces of clothing. Like Pins, clothes also have a brand, and
this also helps influence the current trends in an area. I didn't find myself
exploiting or paying attention to the trends too much during my playthrough.
It's definitely an interesting system though, and there were a few times where I
had to pay attention to the trend, because some brands were completely
ineffective in a specific area!

</figure>

### The Puck

The last big part of combat is the Light Puck.

The Light Puck provides an attack multiplier to whoever is holding it for the
finisher attack that occurs at the end of a combo. This multiplier starts at 2x,
but can be increased up to a maximum of 5x. Once a character performs a
finisher, the Puck is passed to their partner.

If a character passes the Puck back to their partner quickly, the attack
multiplier is increased based on how quickly they passed it. This can play a big
part in combat as building up a high multiplier lets you deal a lot more damage
than you normally would, and if you keep passing the Puck back and forth you can
really tear through enemies if you keep the multiplier going.

Waiting too long to pass the Puck to your partner will decrease the multiplier,
while waiting even longer still causes the Puck to disappear entirely, and you
need to start the whole cycle over. The delay before the Puck disappears can be
increased by having a high Sync value with your partner.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hFJrBmF.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hFJrBmFm.png"/></a>
</figure>

### Food System

Sync is gained by having your characters eat food that you purchase from the
various shops around Shibuya. Sync is helpful to have since it makes passing the
Puck easier, and it decreases by taking damage in battle and when you run from
battles. Taking damage was a pretty regular activity, at least for me, so I
replenished Sync fairly often. Besides the Sync bonus though, there are other
valuable benefits to the food system.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QIfYOoG.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QIfYOoGm.png"/></a>
</figure>

Each food item takes so many "bytes" to digest. Every battle you win causes 1
byte of food to be digested. A character can only be digesting one food item at
a time. You can't just shove 6 cheeseburgers into Neku's face at once!
Additionally, a character can only digest 24 bytes per day in real world time.
Once they're almost full, they also won't eat anything that would push them over
the 24 byte per day limit.

As soon as you give a character a food item, it always increases Sync by some
amount. Once all the bytes of a food item are digested, the character receives
another bonus that varies depending on the food. Many give small, permanent
boosts to stats, like +8 HP, +1 Attack, or +1 Defense. There are some that just
give an extra Sync boost when digested, but these never seemed that useful to me
since you earn Sync by starting to eat food in the first place.

<figure class="third center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/rJPPcpV.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rJPPcpVm.png"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zyI93ag.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zyI93agm.png"/></a>
</figure>

The way food is digested and how it's limited by real world days really caught
me off-guard in a great way. It's just a really interesting mechanic. Real world
time is rarely utilized in RPGs. It might seem like a lame or annoying gimmick,
and I'll admit it's not really a necessary limitation, but...I don't know, I
just found the uniqueness of it really refreshing!

## Closing Thoughts

Despite how long many words it took me to explain the various parts of the
combat in The World Ends With You, it really doesn't take long to learn in-game.
It's surprisingly easy to pick up and get into. The various options given to the
player for controlling the difficulty, and the auto-battle setting, allow you to
get familiar with it at your own pace. There's a ton of depth to the system
though, and a lot of room to get really good at it. Not that the main story
required a lot of skill. It wasn't very difficult, although there were a few
bosses I struggled against, and I ended up playing the last third of the game
entirely on Easy. This was mostly just because I got caught up in the story and
just didn't want to get stuck on Game Overs at all.

<figure class="third center">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/c4uIEdY.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/c4uIEdYm.png"/></a>
</figure>

I'll admit though, I never even got close to mastering the combat. I had usually
let the AI control the top screen for me and just focused on dishing out combos
against the bottom screen enemies though. Even by the end of the game, I still
mostly just focused on the bottom screen, and even just doing that was a *ton*
of fun. I still struggled with bottom screen combat occasionally at the end,
especially when changing up a lot of my equipped pins. I guess that just goes to
show how much the Pins really affect the feeling of combat though, which is a
pretty big plus for combat variety!

<figure class="third center">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/kyAIkrL.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kyAIkrLm.png"/></a>
</figure>

As I've said, the fun and unique combat is *far* from the only thing The World
Ends With You has going for it. The story was outstanding, and held my attention
the whole way through while the awesome musical jams kept pumping all the while.
Any one of these parts, the combat system, the story, or the music, would be
incredible on its own even if the rest of the game it was in wasn't the
greatest. But the fact that all three of these parts of The World Ends With You
are so good makes for a wonderful experience. I wholeheartedly recommend The
World Ends With You to any DS owner, even if it only sounds vaguely interesting
to you. Try it out, and I hope you're pleasantly surprised!
