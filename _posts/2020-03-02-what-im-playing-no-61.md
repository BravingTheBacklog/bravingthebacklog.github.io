things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild *(Switch)*    {#TheLegendofZelda:BreathoftheWild}

Picking up where I'd left off in Breath of the Wild last time, I'd just reached
Zora's Domain. So, the first thing I did this week was meet with King Dorephan
of the Zoras. He asked Link to free the nearby Divine Beat, Vah Ruta, from
Ganon's control, to stop the endless torrent of rainfall plaguing the area. To
aid in this endeavor, he gives Link the Zora Armor which allows you to swim up
waterfalls!

Soon after, I made my way to Vah Ruta. This was my first time seeing a Divine
Beast, and it was an impressive sight! It's a huge mechanical elephant sitting
in the middle of a lake!

This was my first experience with Breath of the Wild's version of a traditional
Zelda dungeon, and it was interesting. It definitely feels different from
dungeons of previous Zelda games. It was a little shorter, and the puzzles had
that unique Breath of the Wild feel. But, there were monsters to fight, treasure
chests to open, a form of dungeon map, and a boss at the end, so it did have
many of the Zelda dungeon staples. Most importantly though, it was fun! With the
Divine Beast freed from Ganon's control, the original pilot, the spirit of the
Zora champion Mipha, took control again and moved Vah Ruta into position to help
Link in his eventual battle against Calamity Ganon. That still feels like it's a
*long* way away though!

</figure>

Coming off of that, I was feeling really pumped to pursue the next Divine Beast!
Due to the sheer size of Hyrule in Breath of the Wild though, I quickly got
distracted. There's just *so* much to explore, it's incredible. Eventually, my
travels took me to the southwest, into the Gerudo Desert region. Here, I caught
my first glimpse of a fully operational Guardian in the distance. Looking at it
through my Scope was pretty intimidating even though I was so far away. I stayed
well clear of it. Making a wide path around that Guardian, I entered Gerudo
Desert and began making my way to Gerudo Town.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

On my way there, I spotted another Divine Beast in the distance. It will no
doubt be my next target, unless I find out I'm unprepared for it at this point
in the game. When I reached the city gates, Link was naturally denied entry
because all men are forbidden from entering the city. I even tried mounting a
Sand Seal and using its fast momentum to rush past the city guards. It didn't
work. I love seeing the Gerudo in a Zelda game again, it really hits me in the
Ocarina of Time nostalgia. Especially when there's NPCs who mention how rare it
is for a male to be born among the Gerudo.

I haven't made it into Gerudo Town yet since I got distracted by another Switch
game this week (more on that later). Initially, Breath of the Wild didn't give
me that "Zelda" feeling, but after seeing Zoras and the Gerudo, and getting a
little further in the main plot, it *definitely* gives me the same vibes as
other Zelda games, despite its differences. This game has a lot of charm, and as
always I'm looking forward to playing more!

### Yoostar 2: In the Movies *(Xbox 360)*    {#Yoostar2:IntheMovies}

After watching CallMeKevin play this on YouTube, PatronusLight and I thought it
looked pretty funny so we bought it off eBay.

    </a>
</figure>

Yoostar 2 uses the Kinect to put you into famous movie scenes. It's an
interesting gimmick, but the jankiness of the experience and our own
unfamiliarity with the included movie scenes are what make it hilarious. When
you act out a scene, the camera on the Kinect records you, and attempts to cut
out the background behind you and put just you into the movie scene. "Attempts"
is the operative word here. The outline it cut around us was often very jagged,
and it would frequently crop off half of our heads too. The game did warn us
that the lighting wasn't good where we have the our Xbox set up, so that might
have affected the end results.

We've had many good laughs over putting ourselves in movie scenes though!
Neither of us has seen many of the movies Yoostar 2 includes scenes from, so
we've often missed or misread lines and had to stumble over words to catch back
up, which is always entertaining!

Just like other Kinect games though, the Kinect controls can be pretty wonky!
We've struggled to control the menus. You're supposed to just move your hands
and it will track them to let you hover over the menu options to pick them. The
tracking is slow and jittery though, so navigating through the menus is pretty
irritating.

I don't have a way to share footage or screenshots from my Xbox 360, so I have
no screenshots or anything to post here. Maybe it's for the best though, since
our performances would be a little embarrassing to share publicly!

### Rune Factory 4 Special *(Switch)*    {#RuneFactory4Special}

Rune Factory 4 originally released for 3DS in North America in 2013. Earlier
this week, the enhanced port was released for Nintendo Switch in North America
as Rune Factory 4 Special. I knew Rune Factory was a Story of Series (originally
Harvest Moon) spin-off series, but had never played one myself. This port gave
me an excellent chance to jump into the Rune Factory series, and I've really
enjoyed it so far!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/56qO0hE.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/56qO0hEm.jpg" alt="Rune Factory 4 Special"/></a>

</figure>

Rune Factory 4 Special shares a lot in common with Stardew Valley, which makes
sense as that game is a lot like Story of Seasons. Stardew Valley may have even
been influenced by the Rune Factory series, as the first game came out in North
America in 2007, long before Stardew Valley. It's not derivative of Stardew
Valley since it originally came out prior to it, but it really is like a high
fantasy, anime Stardew Valley. Anyway, there are farming sim elements as well as
RPG elements here, and also a ton of opportunities for crafting!

<figure class="third">

</figure>

Unlike the Story of Seasons series, there's actually a main quest and plot here.
After choosing whether to play as a male or female character (I chose the male
character and named him Worm), you see your character flying on an airship.
They're carrying some sort of blue stone, but they're attacked by strange
figures on the ship. In the resulting chaos, they drop the blue stone overboard,
and fall overboard themselves! Even though they fell from a great height,
they're somehow unharmed, though they do fall upon Ventuswill, a Native Dragon
and guardian of the town of Selphia. As a result of the attack on the airship,
the player character has lost their memory. Ventuswill tells them to start a new
life in Selphia, and additionally allows them to live in the castle in Selphia,
and makes them a prince. Quite a warm welcome! To be fair, I did cut a few steps
out of the whole prince thing, because a few other things happen leading to
that, but the end result is that the player character is given the
responsibilities and powers of a prince in Selphia.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/m0qemj0.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/m0qemj0m.jpg" alt="tells them to start a new life in Selphia"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dpypi9f.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dpypi9fm.jpg" alt="prince in Selphia"/></a>
</figure>

That's the setup of the plot, and how the player character comes to live in
Selphia. Advancing the plot generally consists of exploring one of the dungeons
that exist outside of town, and fighting monsters within it. Naturally, each
dungeon has a boss at the end of it too. What's nice is you can pursue the plot
at your own pace. I think there was one point early on where I had to advance
the main plot, but after that you can basically do whatever you want with your
time each day. I don't think there's any sort of time limit or anything. The
plot advances at your own pace, which is really nice.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/53rnlJT.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/53rnlJTm.jpg" alt="a boss"/></a>
</figure>

There's also a large cast of characters living in town, with their own
personalities, likes, and dislikes. The characters who are marriage candidates
all get a short animated intro when you first meet them. Just like in Stardew
Valley, you can give everyone a gift each day to raise your relationship with
them. One thing Stardew Valley does better though is that it shows you in the
pause menu whether you've given someone a gift or not that day. Rune Factory 4
doesn't do anything like that, but it's not *too* difficult to remember whether
I've given someone a gift yet in a given day.

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/TFAbZtv.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TFAbZtvm.jpg" alt="a gift"/></a>
</figure>

Another notable feature is befriending monsters by giving them gifts and having
them live in a Monster Barn. This is an interesting replacement for the usual
livestock mechanics of Story of Seasons or Stardew Valley. Once your monsters
have grown friendly enough toward you, you can even have them help you with
fieldwork, and they'll water your crops for you each morning. Growing and
harvesting crops is addicting, and there's so many things to do and skills to
raise. In my eyes, this is like the classic Story of Seasons formula perfected,
with monsters and magic added into the mix, and I love it! I could ramble on
more and more about this game, but I think I'll cut myself off here. I'm sure
I'll be playing Rune Factory 4 Special in the weeks to come, and hopefully I'll
be able to put more coherent thoughts together to analyze it in future posts
instead of just fanboying over it!
