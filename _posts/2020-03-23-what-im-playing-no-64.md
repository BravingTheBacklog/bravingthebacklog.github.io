past week!

things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a

### Neon Struct *(PC)*    {#NeonStruct}

[![Neon Struct](https://i.imgur.com/oy5pXsIm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/oy5pXsI.jpg)
{: .image-right }

At the beginning of the year, in my [Year in Review 2019]({% post_url
2020-01-01-year-in-review-2019 %}) post, I mentioned wanting to finish more
games in 2020. I think a good way to do this is pick shorter games from my Steam
backlog, and work through them over a few short play sessions during the week.
Indie stealth game Neon Struct is the first I've picked for this.

To be honest, I considered dropping it when I saw the art style. It's very
blocky and minimalistic, and in the first moments of the first level I was put
off by this. I decided to give it a chance, and found some solid stealth
gameplay within. Plus, some of the nighttime scenes look rather nice, with the
angular buildings giving things a very striking look.

</figure>

I played through this on Normal difficulty, but there was an Easy mode available
as well as two harder difficulties. I feel like I made the right choice for
myself, as I did pretty well in the early missions after I learned the ropes but
did *very* poorly in the later missions. In those, I was very un-stealthy a lot
of the time, and ended up getting the worst rating on several late game
missions.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

Neon Struct puts you in the shoes of Jillian Cleary, an ex-spy on the run from
her previous employer, the Agency. She's being framed for treason, and has no
choice but to use her skills as former spy to escape capture. It's set in an
alternate 2015 where things like hover cars and bipedal mechs exist. The story
was rather enjoyable and thought provoking, and brings to question the ethics of
government surveillance, mandatory backdoors in software, and other contemporary
topics. It takes place over several levels, where you'll have a specific set of
objectives in each. I founds myself wondering what sort of objectives and
locations the next mission would bring, and each mission was pleasantly unique.
They all involve some amount of sneaking around and/or espionage, and allow the
stealth mechanics and level design to shine.

</figure>

Another element I really enjoyed was the hacking mini-game. It's a miniature
Breakout/Arkanoid clone, but with the added stress that time doesn't pause while
the hacking tool is up. There might be times when you're racing to finish
hacking before a guard's patrol takes them back to you, and it's simply
delightful. I learned later in the game that it's better to position yourself in
complete darkness while hacking whenever possible, so that if a guard does
advance near you while you're hacking, they won't be able to see you.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OBjDFJT.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OBjDFJTm.jpg" alt="hacking"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pGJgWHI.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pGJgWHIm.jpg" alt="better to position yourself in complete darkness while hacking"/></a>
</figure>

My only real criticisms are of the AI and lighting systems. I'm not sure if
there's a difference on higher difficulties, but I found it rather strange that
the AI didn't react to light switches being toggled. I could sneak into a lit
room with a guard in it and turn off the light, plunging them in darkness, and
they don't react at all. With the lighting system, you're given an indicator on
the bottom of the screen that shows how well lit the area you're standing in is.
However, it wasn't always clear to me when looking at distant terrain what would
be in total darkness and what would have 1 bar of light, and the difference is
significant because total darkness will hide you even if a guard is staring
right at you while 1 bar of light will not. Even with those minor complaints,
Neon Struct was really fun though. It's lingered in my Steam backlog for years,
so I'm glad I finally played through it!

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild *(Switch)*    {#TheLegendofZelda:BreathoftheWild}

After some exploring in the fiery region surrounding Death Mountain, I reached
Goron City. There, I learned from the goron elder that Divine Beast Rudania is
causing Death Mountain to be much more active.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qmJvt1A.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qmJvt1Am.jpg" alt="Divine Beast Rudania"/></a>
</figure>

The elder sent me out to find Yunobo, who'd been sent out to fetch painkillers
for the goron elder's back. But before I could rescue Yunobo, I had to equip
myself in proper fireproof gear from the armor shop in town. Then I was ready to
brave the extremely hot abandoned mine area. The lizalfos there gave me some
trouble, their fire arrows hit me *hard* and forced me to eat most of the
recipes I'd brought with me. Eventually I eradicated them all with ice arrows,
and found a cannon to blast Yunobo free from the cave in which he was stuck.
Yunobo is an interesting Goron. He's pretty fearful, and doesn't seem to have
much in common with his ancestor, the goron champion Daruk. For the time being,
I decided to deal with Rudania later, because there was something else I wanted
to investigate first.

</figure>

I followed the hints dropped by several NPCs and headed north to look for the
Master Sword. This lead me to the Lost Woods, and what a beautiful incarnation
of the Lost Woods it is. Thick fog surrounds you and limits your vision, and
even swallows you up and sends you back to the beginning of the Lost Woods
should you stray from the hidden path. Building on this, the music creates this
incredible sense of importance and urgency. I didn't mind getting swallowed up
and lost in the fog, because the music told me I must persevere and find my way
through. After a few failed attempts, I made it through the Lost Woods and found
the Korok Forest, home of the Great Deku Tree and resting place of the Master
Sword. One gripe I have about this area: the frame rate here is *abysmal*. It
felt like 15, maybe 20 FPS at times, especially when moving the camera around.
This was with the Switch docked, maybe it's better undocked, but it tarnished
the experience a bit.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ibHNANX.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ibHNANXm.jpg" alt="the Lost Woods"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/paPOsTg.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/paPOsTgm.jpg" alt="I made it through the Lost Woods"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YUMaG60.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YUMaG60m.jpg" alt="Korok Forest"/></a>
</figure>

Finding the Master Sword waiting within the Great Deku Tree's glade was such a
treat. I love that they put these two Zelda staples together in the same place,
it hits me in the nostalgia so hard. The mechanic for pulling the sword from the
stone is that it constantly drains your HP as you hold the pull button. If your
maximum hearts is too low, you can kill yourself by holding on too long...which
happened to me several times. I looked up the number of hearts I needed online
and saw that I was just *one heart* away, and after a little hunting around for
Shrines to gather a few more Spirit Orbs, I was ready.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5wN8ZIR.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5wN8ZIRm.jpg" alt="the Master Sword"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LfqXLlr.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LfqXLlrm.jpg" alt="within the Great Deku Tree's glade"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RpGEVFw.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RpGEVFwm.jpg" alt="drains your HP as you hold the pull button"/></a>
</figure>

With the proper number of hearts, the Master Sword was mine. The scene after
Link pulls it out was so magical. First, he holds it aloft, and I felt like I
was experiencing Ocarina of Time for the first time all over again because the
same music plays. Then, another flashback cutscene plays. Zelda is shown placing
the Master Sword there for safe keeping, and there's just something special
about seeing Princess Zelda together with the Great Deku Tree and the Master
Sword all in one scene. Plus, the shot of the Master Sword standing in the
pedestal is simply breathtaking.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Eld0ZBc.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Eld0ZBcm.jpg" alt="The scene"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3Q4rVB0.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3Q4rVB0m.jpg" alt="the Master Sword standing in the pedestal"/></a>
</figure>

Master Sword in hand, I was ready to return to Goron City, and take on Divine
Beast Rudania. This meant teaming up with Yunobo to reach it, but first I had to
rescue him from some monsters. After saving him, Yunobo became a living canon
ball and allowed me to shoot him from a canon in order to lower the Bridge of
Eldin. Despite sharing the same name, I don't really see how this could be the
same bridge from Twilight Princess...? Geographically, I don't think the Bridge
of Eldin was that close to Death Mountain in Twilight Princess, and in Breath of
the Wild it's literally next to it. But I digress.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/olnTyC4.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/olnTyC4m.jpg" alt="Bridge of Eldin"/></a>
</figure>

Getting Rudania into a position where I could board it was...an experience. It
was a mini escort mission where I had get Link and Yunobo past a bunch of
searchlights, and if you were seen Yunobo would freak out and become even more
useless, often running the wrong direction in a panic, and Rudania called down
fiery rocks that knocked Link down for what felt like an eternity. I could
complain about this stretch some more, but I think this GIF summarizes my
feelings pretty well.

<figure class="center">

    </div>
</figure>

After saying good-bye to Yunobo and hoping he never got involved in the gameplay
again, I boarded Rudania. As expected, this dungeon was really cool, definitely
up to the same standard as the previous Divine Beast interiors. This one threw a
curveball my way by plunging me into darkness at the beginning of the dungeon
until the map was acquired. It was an interesting touch! From there, it was an
enjoyable ride solving a few puzzles and activating beacons to make my way to
the dungeon boss.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

Fireblight Ganon confronted me. Remembering my struggles with the last Divine
Beast boss I challenged, I readied myself for a potentially frustrating
encounter. But unlike the last one, I had no frustrating roadblocks with this
boss. I think maybe because I learned from my previous struggle, but when its
second phase came up, I immediately began experimenting with different Rune
powers, and eventually figured out how to damage it with one of them. It was
also really nice having the Master Sword to fight the boss with, as it deals
more damage against Ganon's minions. After taking down Fireblight Ganon, Daruk's
spirit was freed, and Rudania was back under his control. Like the Divine Beasts
I liberated before it, Rudania began blasting Hyrule Castle with its laser, and
I got another neat spirit power: Daruk's Protection, which protects Link from
all damage while active and can be used to counter enemy attacks as well. Neat!

</figure>

With that, 3 of 4 Divine Beasts have been liberated from Ganon's clutches. I
feel like I've made a lot of progress in this game now, even though I know
there's still a *lot* I haven't seen. Chances are I'll never see most of it, as
I don't really go for very high completion in massive open world games like
this. But you never know, and for now I'm just enjoying the journey. It was a
good week in Breath of the Wild!

### Animal Crossing: New Horizons *(Switch)*    {#AnimalCrossing:NewHorizons}

Animal Crossing came to Nintendo Switch this week with the release of Animal
Crossing: New Horizons. From everything I've seen so far, this is another
excellent entry in the series, and succeeds in breaking new ground while also
delivering everything I'd expect in an Animal Crossing game. I've really enjoyed
the new gathering and DIY crafting mechanics. The new NookMiles system is
basically like achievements too, which sounds great to me!

<figure class="third">

PatronusLight and I named our island Stardew, because PatronusLight could never
remember the name of the Animal Crossing series. She'd always ask if it was
Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon. She said naming our Animal Crossing island
Stardew would help her remember, and I thought it was funny, so we went with it.
We played co-op for a while on release day, but got discouraged when
PatronusLight couldn't donate insects or fish to Tom Nook, despite the fact that
my character could, and we both had the same options up to that point. I'm not
sure why that happened, but it was pretty sad. I'm hoping once we get a proper
Musuem opened, we'll both be able to donate, but we haven't been able to test
that yet because I donated so many things to Blathers in his tent that he
stopped accepting donations in order to have the full museum built, but that's
going to take another day to finish. Actually, it should be finished by the time
I post this!

<figure class="third">

</figure>

I stumbled upon a familiar face from the series when I found Gulliver,
shipwrecked and passed out on the beach. His groggy dialogue upon waking up is
as entertaining as ever, if not even more so! To get an item from him this time,
I had to find the 5 pieces of his broken communicator, buried in the beaches
around the island. After finding and returning the communicator parts, Gulliver
was able to text his crewmates, and promised to mail me a reward in a few days.
He then proceeded to pace around the beach for the rest of the day as he waited
to get picked up.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/O1MAujL.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O1MAujLm.jpg" alt="Gulliver"/></a>

</figure>

Gulliver's reward showed up the very next day, a Statue of Liberty statue. I put
it on display in my brand new house! Moving up from tent life was a big
improvement, because not only is the house bigger, but you can customize the
floors and walls, use the new "designer" mode to decorate (which I love, by the
way!), and *most importantly* it has a built-in Storage inventory! Storage is
awesome! Being able to dump stuff from my pockets into Storage after I walk into
my house and not have them clutter the floor is wonderful. New Leaf's closets
and other containers were similar to Storage I suppose, and maybe better in some
ways since you could also access those items from the lockers at the train
station. But for all I know there's an ability to unlock in New Horizons down
the line that makes storage even more powerful, like allowing you to access it
from other areas outside your home as well.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/45ofzSM.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/45ofzSMm.jpg" alt="put it on display in my brand new house"/></a>

</figure>

Naturally, having a house built is not free. Luckily, the Tom Nook repayment
plan is as lax as can be. The cost of my home loan is 98,000 bells, but Nook
charges no interest for this, and it can be paid off whenever. I don't know how
he stays in business like this, but I am a fan of this repayment plan! Also,
he'll be opening a shop on the island soon, which Timmy or Tommy will likely
run, but he needs resources to do it. I've been tasked with gathering resources
for the new shop. The wood was easy to gather, but the iron ore is a little more
rare. Luckily, another new feature was introduced around the same time: the
ability to fly to randomized deserted islands on mystery tours!

<figure class="third">

</figure>

These random islands are cool for several reasons. One, they have rocks so I can
use them to harvest iron ore faster. Two, they have random fruit, which should
help me get all the different kinds of fruit on my island eventually. Lastly,
you can find new potential villagers here! I visited two islands, one with the
Nook Miles Ticket that was gifted to me from Tom Nook, and another I redeemed
with my own Nook Miles points. On one island, I met Gladys, and on the second
island I met Agent S. I invited both to move to Stardew, so hopefully they'll
show up in the next few days! I like the look of them both, but I'm especially
excited for Agent S because he's some sort of secret agent or Power Ranger or
something? I didn't get a good screenshot of him, but he seems like an
interesting villager for sure!

That about wraps up my first weekend with New Horizons. It's such a relaxing,
chill game. I'd expect nothing less from Animal Crossing, of course! Thanks for
reading, I'm sure I'll have plenty more to share about my island for weeks to
come.
