### Murder By Numbers *(PC)*    {#MurderByNumbers}

Let's play picross. It's easy! The numbers tell you how many squares should be
filled in for the column or row. If there's more than one number, that means
there's multiple groupings of filled in squares in the row with empty spaces
between them. When you complete the puzzle, it turns into a picture. That's how
you solve picross puzzles! For the next step, get divorced and grab your crime
solving robot buddy, because it's time to use your picross skills to solve a
murder!

I recently discovered picross (also known as nonogram) puzzles and got hooked,
starting with Picross DS on my 3DS. Then realized that I actually had a picross
game in my Steam library - Murder by Numbers! It's a hybrid puzzle/visual novel
game developed by MediaTonic that released in 2020 for Switch and PC. There's a
pretty good tutorial in the game if you're new to picross. It teaches you the
basics and also has more advanced tips available in the menu to help you work
through the tougher puzzles.

The puzzles are the star of the show here. I've found the incremental puzzle
solving nature of them *very* satisfying. Using logic to determine which squares
definitely need to be filled in gradually gives you more and more information
for surrounding rows and columns. Crossing out squares and filling out the grid
bit by bit is very relaxing, and I think the music of Murder by Numbers does a
good job reinforcing that feeling most of the time.

There's also a very nice Hints option for when you want extra help with a
puzzle. You can toggle Hints on or off at any time during a puzzle. Using Hints
doesn't subtract from your score, and having them on will highlight which rows
and columns you have potential moves in based on what you've filled in and
crossed out so far. They're *very* helpful at keeping things moving. Probably
because I'm relatively new to Picross puzzles, I would sit and stare at some
puzzles for minutes trying to figure out the next move when I didn't have hints
on. I didn't use them for the first two chapters, but after I started using them
in chapter 3, there was no going back. I ended up having Hints on all the time
after that, which feels a little like cheating, but it really kept the pace
moving and I liked never feeling stuck. I feel like it helped me become better
at picross in general too, as I would sometimes look at a highlighted column and
not even realize *what* the possible move there was until I thought about it a
bit more, which in turn taught me strategies I could take into future puzzles or
even other picross games.

One thing to remember about the puzzles, you won't be told when you make a
mistake. You only know you have the right answer when you complete the final row
or column and the puzzle turns into a colored, pixelated image. You might think
you almost have a puzzle solved, only to realize that one of the rows or columns
doesn't work out. In that case, you can either try to find your mistake
manually, or use more of the built-in helpers. I used the Check for Errors
option several times when I found myself in this situation, which marks squares
you've incorrectly filled in or crossed out with an exclamation point for a few
seconds. This does lower your score for the puzzle though, so if you want to get
a perfect score for each case, you'll need to solve all the puzzles without
using these helpers.

The writing in the visual novel sections is full of jokes and references. It's
set in the 90s, and I love all the 90s references to things like Usenet, VHS
tapes, and so on. You play as Honor and her new robotic companion, SCOUT as they
work as aspiring detectives to solve several murders in 90s Hollywood. I have to
say, I love all the puns in these character names. SCOUT and Honor, for instance
("scout's honor"), there's another character named Becky Call ("beck and call").
There's more pun names as well, probably even some that went right over my head,
but those are the ones that stuck out to me most.

The story is split into four Cases, each following a different murder case.
They're a bit formulaic, but they tell an enjoyable story and the fun characters
and humor make up for it. The whole experience is quite light-hearted, but there
are a few moments here and there that tug on your heartstrings. It's *really*
not about solving murder mysteries though. If you're looking for a deep
mystery-solving fix, you'll have to find it elsewhere. The cast of characters in
each case is small, so it's not surprising finding out who the killer is each
time since the suspect list is tiny. But it's still fun, they're not going for
mind-bending twists or in-depth investigative logic. Instead, it's all about
solving some nonogram puzzles, and following along with Honor and SCOUT's
light-hearted story. The gameplay outside of the puzzle sections is very
straightforward too. You'll question some characters and have a few dialogue
options with them, and you're able to show them items from your inventory, but
that's about the extent of player freedom. It's never too hard to figure out
what you need to do to advance the story, but that's kind of nice for a relaxed
puzzle game like this.

The hardest part of the game for me was the hacking mini-game, where you have to
quickly solve several simple 5x5 puzzles within the time limit. One of these
segments in one of the last two cases gave me *so* much trouble. If you make a
mistake, you lose a *big* chunk of time, and you really don't have much time to
spare on these. If you run out of time, you have to start over from the
beginning, and the puzzles aren't the same every time. This part was fun when it
was going well, but as soon as I made a mistake I started to panic a bit, which
meant I was inevitably going to fail and have to start over. This part feels a
little at-odds with the rest of the game's relaxing tone. The time limit forces
you to hurry, but if you're like me, hurrying just makes you more prone to
mistakes and failure. It is pretty thrilling when you finish the last puzzle
with just a few seconds to spare though!

Murder by Numbers is a great indie puzzle game. The characters and writing were
fun and provide a nice interlude between puzzles. If the premise of the game
sounds interesting to you, or if you've played some nonogram puzzle games before
and want to dig into another one, check this one out! My final time was 27 hours
43 minutes. That's mostly just from completing the four main story Cases, but
there's also bonus puzzles available from the main menu, called SCOUT's
Memories, and you unlock a few more of these by completing the cases with high
rankings. So even after you finish the story, Murder by Numbers *still* has more
puzzle-solving goodness for you if you want it!
