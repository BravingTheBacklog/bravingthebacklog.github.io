title: Top 10 Games I Enjoyed but Never Finished
---

Sometimes you're playing a game and you just need to drop your playthrough
before you finish it. A lot of us have probably done this. This doesn't always
mean it's a bad game though, I've stopped playing games before I finished them
even if I was enjoying it. Maybe it's a difficult boss battle, maybe it's the
gameplay in general, or maybe there's just another more exciting game you want
to play instead. There are lots of reasons to stop playing a game you enjoy. The
following is just a short list of games I enjoyed playing, but never finished
for one reason or another.

<!--more-->

These aren't really in any specific order, although I would say that #1 *is*
probably the game I most regret never finishing!

My list was inspired by gamergal.exe's list with the same premise, which you can

[over on their blog here](https://gamergalexe.wordpress.com/2019/04/11/11-games-i-loved-but-never-finished-1111/)!

## 10. Alan Wake

    <ul>
        <li>Developer: Remedy Entertainment</li>
        <li>Release: February 16, 2012</li>
        <li>Platform: PC</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

Alan Wake was okay. The story seemed genuinely interesting, and I did enjoy what
I saw, but the gameplay never had me hooked. The atmosphere was also cool, but
playing the game just wasn't doing anything for me. Once I realized the gameplay
wasn't going to click with me, it didn't take me long to drop my playthrough.

## 9. Phantasy Star

    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developer: SEGA</li>
        <li>Release: November, 1988</li>
        <li>Platform: SEGA Master System</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

I'd played some of Phantasy Star II on a PC compilation SEGA released in the
early 2000s. The first game in the series, Phantasy Star, I'd had no exposure to
until much more recently. On a whim, I decided I wanted to see the series'
roots.

Playing through with a guide, I enjoyed this game as a cool romp through
video game history. It's an early RPG, and it's cool to see a lot of staple RPG
mechanics even back in the early days of console RPGs. In the end I ended my
playthrough because I decided I'd seen enough, and while playing through with a
guide was fun, it wasn't much different than watching a playthrough of it
online. If I recall correctly, I did watch the ending of the game online, just
to see the conclusion.

## 8. LEGO Jurassic World

    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developer: TT Fusion</li>
        <li>Release: June 10, 2015</li>
        <li>Platform: Xbox 360</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

PatronusLight and I love playing LEGO video games together, but for whatever
reason LEGO Jurassic World is one we started, but then never played again! I
attribute this to a few things. Our copy is on Xbox 360, and was a Christmas
gift. But, at the time we got it, our Xbox 360 gaming days were coming to an
end. I had just built a mid-range gaming PC and begun building my Steam library,
so a lot of my gaming was happening on PC. We also had recently bought a PS3, so
my PS3 gaming days were just beginning. Those factors combined to essentially
make us both forget about LEGO Jurassic World, which is a shame because it
covers not only Jurassic World, but also the 3 Jurassic Park films, all of which
I enjoy.

## 7. The Guided Fate Paradox

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xAeOOQd.jpg">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xAeOOQdm.jpg" />
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developer: Nippon Ichi Software</li>
        <li>Release: November 5, 2013</li>
        <li>Platform: PlayStation 3</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

This is a roguelike game on the PS3, and it was pretty fun! It's hugely anime, a
lot of the characters are the embodiment of one anime trope or another. The
gameplay was fun too, exploring dungeons and gathering experience and equipment.

In roguelike fashion, each dungeon starts you off at level 1. But, you can gain
permanent stat boosts and upgrades for your character that persist across
dungeon runs using the rewards you get from returning alive from a dungeon. I
don't remember all of the mechanics anymore, since it's been a while since I
played it. I think what drove me away was a combination of getting distracted by
other games I got close to the same time, and the difficulty. You definitely
have to do some grinding here, things get pretty tough otherwise!

## 6. Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wkumOY8.jpg">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wkumOY8m.jpg" />
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developer: Triumph Studios</li>
        <li>Release: July 25, 2003</li>
        <li>Platform: PC</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic is the third game released in the Age of Wonders
series. I'm pretty sure I got my copy at a school book fair in middle school.
Wherever I got it from, it made quite an impression. Between the magic-filled
fantasy world, the tactical combat, city management, and role-playing elements,
I was blown away by the whole package. Seriously, wizards and magic in Age of
Wonders are *awesome*, Wizard's Towers are *so* tall, it was the coolest thing
ever when I was a kid and it kind of still is. Anyway, the combination of all
these gameplay elements also meant that it was a lot to juggle, and I was never
able to finish all the campaign missions.

I still have a lot of nostalgia for this game, but realistically I'll never
finish it. From the hours I poured into as a kid, it feels like I'll just never
be very good at this game. Maybe I'll play it a bit more someday for nostalgia's
sake, but chances are I'll end up trying the next game in the series - Age of
Wonders III - to experience something new before I ever play Shadow Magic again.

## 5. The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5jvlUwt.jpg">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5jvlUwtm.jpg" />
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developer: Nintendo EAD</li>
        <li>Release: December 7, 2009</li>
        <li>Platform: Nintendo DS</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

Spirit Tracks has a lot of really cool, unique elements for the series. For one,
trains are a central part of the game, and these don't often, if ever, feature
in The Legend of Zelda. Secondly, Zelda takes a larger role in the adventure
here, but she's a ghost for much of it!

I honestly don't remember why I stopped playing this game. From what I remember,
it was pretty fun and I did enjoy it. At some point I must have gotten
distracted by another game or something, and just left my Spirit Tracks
playthrough by the wayside.

## 4. Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vrjX2N0.jpg">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vrjX2N0m.jpg" />
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developer: Rare</li>
        <li>Release: November 20, 1995</li>
        <li>Platform: SNES</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

I like platformers like Donkey Kong Country 2 quite a bit. Modern platformers
like Super Meat Boy or Slime-San have shifted the balance of gameplay to require
extreme practice or skill, and are designed with the expectation that you'll
fail a lot before you can complete an individual level. Platformers like Super
Mario World or Donkey Kong Country can have some difficulty, but I think overall
their design doesn't require anywhere near the perfection that some modern
platformers do. Personally, I enjoy the style of Super Mario World or Donkey
Kong Country a lot more.

So, in my youth I played a decent chunk of Donkey Kong Country 2. Despite my
efforts, I was never able to complete it though! At the time, I just couldn't
make it past certain levels! I think I got somewhat close to the end, I sort of
remember reaching the K. Rool's Keep world, but I never made it any further.
This was the only Donkey Kong Country game I had on SNES, though I remember
renting Donkey Kong Country 3 from a video store at least once. Due to its
presence in my childhood, I do like the idea of completing Donkey Kong Country 2
someday. It's possible I'll revisit it at some point in the future.

## 3. Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Lpyweet.jpg">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lpyweetm.jpg" />
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developer: Capcom</li>
        <li>Release: January 15, 2016</li>
        <li>Platform: PC</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

I thought everything in Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen was fun and exciting. I
liked its gameplay mechanics and medieval fantasy setting. The idea of climbing
on a monster's back to strike at it during combat is really cool, and Dragon's
Dogma allows you to do exactly that! But, after playing it for a bit, I got to a
point where I just felt stuck.

To be honest, I didn't really know how to advance the main quest at that point.
I had a marker on my map far in the distance, but I couldn't figure out how to
reach it. After some aimless wandering about, eventually I just called it quits
and uninstalled it. Its not out of the question for me to give Dragon's Dogma
another try someday, but its not at the top of my to-do list. For what its worth
though, I really enjoyed what I played of it!

## 2. How To Survive

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NRrnrYP.jpg">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NRrnrYPm.jpg" />
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developer: Eko Software</li>
        <li>Release: October 23, 2013</li>
        <li>Platform: PC</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

I think the reason I quit How to Survive was a boss battle near (or at?) the end
of the game. The third-person survival action was something I enjoyed a lot
throughout the rest of the game, but once I hit that point I guess I'd had
enough and considered my knowledge of How To Survive adequate.

## 1. Super Mario RPG The Legend of the Seven Stars

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/M0GzjTF.jpg">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/M0GzjTFm.jpg" />
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developer: Square</li>
        <li>Release: May 13, 1996</li>
        <li>Platform: Super Nintendo</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

Super Mario RPG is a game I loved playing on the SNES. Despite this, it's also a
game I never completed. I think the reasons why probably boil down to my
inexperience when I originally played it. I got all the way to the final boss,
but I just could not defeat them as a kid. Since then, I've replayed Super Mario
RPG via emulation, only to get stuck on what I think is some weird emulation
bug, because I can't make it past a late game area!

In the end, this is the game I'm most disappointed I never finished, as I've
always enjoyed it a lot, yet I've still never reached the ending!
