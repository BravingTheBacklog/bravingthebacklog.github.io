title: Top 10 PS3 Games in my Backlog
---

Maybe it's the fact that I'm currently playing Valkyria Chronicles, which was
originally a PS3 game, or simply that I haven't made one of these lists for the
system yet, but I recently developed the urge to scrutinize and prioritize my
PS3 backlog. The result is this list you see before you, the top 10 PS3 games in
my backlog!

<!--more-->

One thing I kept in mind when prioritizing these games is whether I already
owned them or not. Low on the list you have titles I haven't gotten a copy of
yet, and higher you have all the games I *do* have, but haven't finished. I am
really excited about some of the games lower on the list, but I want to make an
effort to play the games I already own first.

To be honest, I'm not sure how soon I'll get to any of these, mainly because I
don't have a way to capture screenshots while playing them. Unlike the PS4,
there's no built-in screenshot feature on the PS3. To capture on real hardware,
you need some sort of capture card. Emulating some of these *might* be possible,
but PS3 emulation on PC still isn't perfect, and I don't think I have a powerful
enough PC anyway.

All that aside though, I'm looking forward to playing these games eventually! On
to the list!

## 10. {% include game.html game="The Sly Collection" %}

The Sly Collection contains HD remasters of the Sly Cooper trilogy. They're
described as stealth platformers, featuring the anthropomorphic raccoon, Sly
Cooper.

Since I didn't have a PS2 as a kid, the Sly Cooper games are one of many
PlayStation franchises I missed out on.

## 9. {% include game.html game="Ratchet & Clank Collection" %}

I remember playing the original Ratchet & Clank at a friend's house a long time
ago. It seemed like a really cool and funny game! But since I didn't have a PS2,
I only played it for that very short time. Eventually I forgot about it, but now
years later I'm remembering that time, and I think it's a series I'd like to
play for myself!

## 8. {% include game.html game="Tales of Graces f" %}

As a Tales Of fan, I have to fill the gap in my Tales knowledge by playing the
definitive version of Graces someday. Originally a Japanese exclusive Wii game,
the PS3 port bears the "f" suffix and features some additional content and HD
graphics. Most importantly though, it released internationally!

I'm especially curious about this game because I've read several opinions online
that the battle system in Graces is the best in the series. That's a very strong
recommendation!

## 7. {% include game.html game="The Guided Fate Paradox" %}

The premise here is you play as a young man who stumbles into the role of God.
He's guided by an eccentric group of angels who help him to grant peoples'
wishes. You do this by navigating randomly generated floors of dungeons,
fighting enemies within.

I actually started playing this one a while back. It's a pretty fun little
roguelike that's *very* anime, and from what I played, a pretty light-hearted,
humorous story. I just kind of stopped playing it though, I'll have to pick it
up again sometime!

## 6. {% include game.html game="The Disgaea Triple Play Collection" %}

Disgaea is a series of strategy RPGs known for over the top humor, characters,
and mechanics. These can be *huge* time sinks if you want to grind, and I think
you probably have to grind to at least some extent. I mean, series is known for
having a level cap of 9999. That's outrageous, and kind of awesome! I played a
*little* of the first 2 games, but didn't finish either of them. Besides D2,
which is a direct sequel to the first Disgaea, none of the games require you to
have played other games in the series, so I should be able to jump into the
Triple Play Collection pretty easily.

The Disgaea Triple Play Collection contains Disgaea 3, 4, and D2. These were all
originally released on PS3 separately, but in the Triple Play Collection they're
all present on a single disc. Interestingly, this compilation only released in
North America and Europe. It never released in Japan. The individual games in
the collection did, of course, but this 3-in-1 disc did not.

## 5. {% include game.html game="Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster" %}

Shortly after I got a PS3, I picked up this Final Fantasy X collection, wanting
to get more into Final Fantasy. I started it, didn't get very far, and just got
distracted by other games and stopped playing it. X seems to be slightly
divisive among Final Fantasy fans, since it took more steps away from the
classic Final Fantasy formula of the prior games, although I think it's
generally liked for its story and battles. Either way, I intend to form my own
opinion on it!

## 4. {% include game.html game="God of War III" %}

I want to get into the God of War series. They seem like fun, action-packed hack
'n' slash games. Hopefully the 3rd one is a good place to start! I may be a
little lost jumping into the story at this point, but I can always read a
synopsis of the story up until that point.

## 3. {% include game.html game="Star Ocean The Last Hope" %}

Here's another game I picked up intending for it to be my entry point to the
series. I played the tutorial and the battle system seemed really cool,
reminiscent of Tales Of. This makes sense given the two series history, namely
how Star Ocean was created by Tales of Phantasia developers who left to form
tri-Ace and developed the first Star Ocean game. Embarassingly I couldn't figure
out what to do to get past the first area in the game...so I gave up. I'm not
really sure why I was so stumped so early in the game, but hopefully now that
I'm older and wiser I'll have no trouble with it on my second attempt!

## 2. {% include game.html game="Infamous" %}

Infamous puts you in the shoes of Cole MacGrath in the aftermath of an explosion
in Empire City that leaves him with electricity-based super powers. It's an open
world action-adventure game that allows you to direct Cole to use his new powers
for either good or evil, with two different endings depending on your choice.

As I mentioned in [my least valuable games post]({% post_url 2019-10-10-top-10-least-valuable-games-in-my-collection %}), I picked up Infamous
and its sequel for cheap. I haven't touched them yet though! If I enjoy the
first game enough, I might continue right on with Infamous 2 afterward.

## 1. {% include game.html game="Resonance of Fate" %}

Resonance of Fate is a steampunk-inspired RPG centered around a trio of
mercenaries earning their living around the mechanical tower, Basel. The battle
system is very unique. It's turn-based, but attacks are very unique. You order
your characters to run, jump, and shoot enemies in mid-air. I actually started
playing this a few years back, but I never really grasped the battle mechanics.
I might need to watch or read a tutorial to get the gist of the mechanics,
because clearly the in-game tutorial just wasn't enough for me.

I'm really excited to play Resonance of Fate! The battle system intrigued me
despite my struggles with it when I played some of it before, but the world and
characters are especially interesting to me. One of the main characters is
voiced by Scott Menville, who also voices Lloyd Irving in Tales of Symphonia,
and that's pretty cool!
