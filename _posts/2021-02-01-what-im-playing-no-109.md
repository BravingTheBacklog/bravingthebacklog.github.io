Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

I only played one game again last week: Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse. There
are *minor* late game spoilers within, mostly of bosses you fight and characters
you meet. I haven't spoiled anything major, but if you want to remain completely
spoiler-free you should still avoid this post.

### Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse *(3DS)*    {#ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse}

You know what's cool? When you get to the point in a game where you're able to
fuse demons together to get bosses you fought earlier in the game as allies.
Okay, this feeling might be pretty specific to SMT...but it's *awesome*. I
didn't use these former boss demons in my party much, but just having them
available is cool, it really makes you feel how much you've progressed. Speaking
of progress, we *finally* got to take revenge on the demon who killed Nanashi at
the beginning of the game, Adramalech. That was a cathartic fight!

Anyway, the story took some intense turns this week, with new characters showing
up, new gods, and new mustaches appearing on the faces of friends. That last one
was a pretty funny and heartwarming scene, basically the teenagers in the group
had to disguise themselves to seem older in order to fool some angels into
thinking they were Samurai, since all Samurai are at least 18 due to the
Gauntlet Rite taking place at that age.

Not everything was light-hearted though. Some of the darkest twists yet
occurred, and I think things could have been even darker if I had made different
choices and pursued different endings. I don't want to spoil those twists
though. They were foreshadowed a *little* in-game, but the specifics of how they
played out still surprised and shocked me in wonderful ways.

I think I'm *pretty* close to the end of the game now. The dungeon I'm currently
in has a real "final dungeon" feel to it, and I really don't know how the plot
could continue past this point. I guess I wouldn't be *mad* if this wasn't the
end though, because I really love this cast and the gameplay, and the pacing has
been great too. I'm definitely curious how many different endings and routes
this game has, but as of right now I don't have plans to do a New Game+
playthrough to get any additional endings. I'll probably just read about the
other endings and routes afterward, at least for now. Long-term though, I'd
definitely consider replaying this one!
