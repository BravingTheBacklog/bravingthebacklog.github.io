title: Top 10 GameCube Games In My Backlog
---

I've covered my Top 10 Favorite GameCube games here on the blog before. The
Nintendo GameCube certainly provided me a wealth of enjoyable games that I
remember fondly to this day. But what about the games I never got a chance to
play on Nintendo's iconic cube-esque console? Well, read on to discover the Top
10 GameCube Games In My Backlog.

<!--more-->

## 10. {% include game.html game="Doshin the Giant" %}

My earliest memory of learning this game existed comes from Super Smash Bros.
Melee, where there's a trophy of the Giant. I thought the giant looked kind of
weird. I mean, he's a huge naked yellow humanoid, that's not something you see
every day. To this day, I don't really know much about this game, other than the
fact that it only released in English in the PAL region, never North America,
and that it's some sort of sim/god game. Since I was in the NTSC region with
an NTSC GameCube, and the GameCube doesn't allow playing games from a different
region, I never was able to play it!

It remains a GameCube game I am interested in trying, due to my inability to
play it when it originally came out.

## 9. {% include game.html game="Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights" %}

I think I saw an ad for this as a kid. At the time I thought it was so cool
because I liked Scooby-Doo, and seeing the characters in 3D in a video game was
*so cool*. Then I forgot about it. Now, I realize it exists again and I gotta
say, I kind of want to try it even though it's almost guaranteed to be...not
great.

It might be a passable game, *maybe* even a *good* game, but I don't think
"Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights" is liable to be anyone's Game of the Year or
anything like that.

## 8. {% include game.html game="Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance" %}

Honestly my reasons for wanting to play this game seem pretty flimsy. I
recognize the Baldur's Gate series, having heard great things about the PC
titles yet never having played those either. I enjoy fantasy settings and the
occasional hack 'n' slash game. That's about the entirety of my reasons for
including this one. The co-op mode also sounds like it'd be fun, but I've yet to
lure someone in to play this one with me. Maybe PatronusLight and I can play
through Dark Alliance together someday!

## 7. {% include game.html game="Battalion Wars" %}

For some reason, I never had this game. But, I'm almost positive I had the
sequel on the Wii, either that or I borrowed it from a friend for an extended
amount of time. Actually, now that I think about it, I definitely borrowed it
from a friend. Thanks, Brad! Anyway, I'd like to experience the original
Battalion Wars someday. I remember the sequel being pretty fun, for the most
part. There were a few frustrating missions for young bsinky, but I don't know
if that was due to a childhood lack of skill or legitimate difficulty.

Either way, the first Battalion Wars has always piqued my interest.

## 6. {% include game.html game="Phantasy Star Online Episode I II Plus" %}

Phantasy Star Online was originally a Dreamcast game, before being ported to the
GameCube as "Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II," and featured additional
content compared to the Dreamcast version. Later, another enhanced version came
out on the GameCube, the title that snagged this spot on my list, "Phantasy Star
Online Episode I & II Plus."

As the title suggests, online play was a key factor when the game came out. I've
long since missed the boat on that, I believe all the official servers shut down
years ago, although it sounds like there may be fan-maintained servers
available. However, one of the improvements made in the jump from Dreamcast to
GameCube was the addition of local split-screen support!

The split-screen here intrigues me. The idea of getting a few friends together
and playing this sounds like it could be fun! Although, the I imagine we would
be emulating it and using Dolphin's NetPlay to play over the Internet, so that's
a lot of overhead and lags/stutters would hurt the experience. So that may never
happen, but maybe PatronusLight and I can try this in local split-screen
someday.

## 5. {% include game.html game="Evolution Worlds" %}

This is the second game on this list that was originally a Dreamcast game. Or
rather, it was originally *two* Dreamcast games. After the death of the
Dreamcast, the two games were ported to the GameCube and released as Evolution
Worlds, although the first game was trimmed down in the process, possibly to get
Evolution Worlds to fit on a single GameCube disc. It's a JRPG, and thus
promises a considerable story, dungeons to explore, and enemies to defeat in
turn-based combat.

Evolution Worlds isn't reviewed all that highly, sitting at a 63 on Metacritic
as of this writing. But, the User Score on Metacritic was 8.0, so that's got to
count for something, right? Personally, I like JRPGs, so I'm hoping I'll find
Evolution Worlds to be more like the 8.0 User Score than the 63 aggregate critic
score.


## 4. {% include game.html game="Second Sight" %}

Second sight seems like another game I must have heard about in Nintendo Power,
or Game Informer, or some similar gaming magazine. I remember thinking the
premise sounded very interesting and mature, an amnesiac man with psychic powers
breaking free from a medical facility. The psychic powers sounded like they'd be
very fun to play around with too!

The game isn't a GameCube exclusive, it came out on the 3 major consoles at the
time by releasing on PS2 and Xbox as well. What I didn't know, until reading up a
bit on it for this article, is that it also had a PC release. However, despite
the number of platforms it's available on, I missed out on it entirely.
Hopefully I'll remedy that someday and get my fix of psychic-power-infused
stealth action! I mean, who doesn't want psychic powers, right? ...It's not just
me, right?

## 3. {% include game.html game="Viewtiful Joe" %}

This side-scrolling beat 'em up released in 2003 to critical acclaim, and was
commercially successful enough to spawn a few sequels and even manga and anime
adaptations. The Demo/Preview disc that came with my GameCube had a Viewtiful
Joe demo on it, and as a kid it always struck me as a strange game. I mean,
you're this ordinary dude, but then you collect some things and strike a weird
pose, call out a catchphrase, and transform in to a superhero. Now that I'm a
bit older I think I can appreciate the intent and the humor there, but as a kid
I just thought it was weird. Fun though!

I always thought it was cool how it was like you were in a movie, with the
director yelling "Cut, cut, cut!" when you lose all your health and have to
restart. That happened to me a lot in the demo. I was not good at this game!
Maybe when I start playing the full version of the game, I can redeem myself!

## 2. {% include game.html game="Baten Kaitos Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean" %}

Card-based battles. There's a system you don't see every day. That's exactly
what Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean brings to the table. I've
played games that employ card-themed systems before, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of
Memories comes to mind, though I'm not sure how similar the systems actually
are. Given the card-based battles, I'm sure deck-building plays a large role.
Having too many cards, or too few, could mean disaster if you can't draw the
cards you need when you need them, giving it the potential for quite a bit of
strategy.

I've actually briefly played Baten Kaitos before a few years ago, I wanted to
see what the card mechanics were like. What I played, I enjoyed, and I'm looking
forward to picking up this game for real sometime!

## 1. {% include game.html game="Skies of Arcadia Legends" %}

I know Skies of Arcadia was originally a Sega Dreamcast game, released in 2000.
Skies of Arcadia Legends is mostly a straight-up port to the GameCube, with a
few changes and tweaks here and there. Legends released in 2003, but for one
reason or another, I never knew it existed back in my GameCube playing days.
Maybe it wasn't marketed very well.

In any case, it has pretty great review scores from critics and fans alike,
though the Metacritic score for the Dreamcast version (93 at time of writing) is
much more impressive than the score for the GameCube version (84 at time of
writing). The premise sounds great, the setting is full of continents floating
in the sky and airships, while the gameplay promises to deliver classic
turn-based battles and city, dungeon, and world map exploration. The story is
said to be excellent, and the game overall is filled with character. Basically
everything I could ask for in a JRPG!
