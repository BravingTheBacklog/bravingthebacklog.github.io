### Fire Emblem Engage *(Switch)*    {#FireEmblemEngage}

Fire Emblem Engage is an extremely fun game. It looks great, with excellent
battle animations for things like critical hits and dodges, and nice character
models. The music is great, and the gameplay is *super* polished, featuring a
nice blend of series staples and new mechanics. Battles in this game might just
have the best turn-based strategy the series has ever seen. It feels like an
amalgamation of all the 3DS Fire Emblems: Awakening, Fates, and Echoes. It has a
world map like Awakening and Echoes, no weapon durability like Fates and Echoes,
and the ability to undo turns like Echoes (and Three Houses). Personally, I was
really excited to see the World Map return in particular. I've always really
enjoyed the Fire Emblem games with World Maps ever since I first played Sacred
Stones. Seeing your little character move around the map space by space is just
really charming. There's also a nameable player character in Engage, who's much
more like Robin or Corrin than Byleth because they're not a silent protagonist,
although you can't customize their appearance beyond choosing their gender. The
default name for them is Alear, but I named him Pepsiman.

The story is a pretty simple, good vs. evil adventure. Alear is a Divine Dragon
who defeated the Fell Dragon, Sombron, 1000 years ago, and then fell into a deep
sleep. Waking up after 1000 years, Alear learns that the Fell Dragon is stirring
once again, so they need to travel around the world to collect the twelve Emblem
Rings before the followers of Sombron get them first in order to prevent the
Fell Dragon from returning to power and taking over the world. It's an enjoyable
adventure, somewhat predictable but there were still some moments that caught me
by surprise. My biggest complaints about the story happen late in the game, so I
won't spoil them here, but there are some scenes where it tries to give some
villains an empathetic backstory, and those felt pretty heavy-handed. I think if
they wanted to develop their villains, they should have started doing it earlier
instead of trying to squeeze it into the closing moments of the game. Aside from
that though, I enjoyed the story for what it is: a fun adventure.

Not only are the Emblem Rings central to the plot, the biggest new gameplay
mechanic also comes from them. Emblems are the spirits of heroes from other Fire
Emblem games, and they live in the Emblem Rings. Wearing one of the rings allows
a unit to summon the Emblem to fight alongside them in battle, providing them
with several bonuses. They can also Engage with the Emblem, temporarily fusing
with them for a few turns and changing their appearance while giving them access
to Emblem Weapons associated with that Emblem, powerful skills, and a special
attack that they can only use once per Engagement. For example, Engaging with
Emblem Marth allows you to wield the Falchion, and gives you access to the
Lodestar Rush skill, a multi-hit flurry of attacks. Some Emblems provide really
powerful skills while Engaged, like how one of Emblem Sigurd's skills gives you
+5 movement while Engaged, letting you run practically halfway across the map.

Characters also have a Bond level with each Emblem that increases as they use
them, though you can also spend Bond Fragments at the Arena to quickly level up
Bonds. As a character's Bond with an Emblem increases, they'll gain access to
new skills and Emblem Weapons while using that Emblem, and they also have a very
simplified version of a Support conversation with the Emblem every five levels.
And I mean, *very* simplified, these Bond conversations are usually only two
sentences long.

Another thing characters will gain from increasing their Bond with certain
Emblems are weapon proficiencies. These are needed to change their classes,
either changing them to a different Base class with a Second Seal, or changing
them to an Advanced Class with a Master Seal once they're at least level 10.
Characters have certain innate weapon proficiencies, and if those are the only
weapon proficiencies needed for a class they'll be able to change to it no
problem. But if a character only has a proficency in lances and you want to
change them to a class that requires lance and axe proficiency, you'll first
need to increase their Bond with an Emblem that gives axe proficiency at some
level, like Leif. This is an interesting way to handle class changes, it gives
you a lot of flexibility to reclass units to whatever class you want, but you
can also just ignore the proficiencies from Bonds and promote units to the
Advanced versions of their starting classes if you want. That's pretty much what
I did, I didn't drastically change the class of any characters I was actually
using. I messed around a bit with characters who weren't in my main party
though, I had a good laugh when I made old man Lindon into a warrior.

I really like the nostalgia factor of the Emblems. I've played every mainline
Fire Emblem game that has an official localization, so seeing these classic Fire
Emblem characters brought back was awesome. Each Emblem has a Paralogue
available later in the game. In each one, they'll talk a little bit about a
pivotal moment from their own adventure, and then Alear will have to clear their
trial which features a remake of a map from their game. It's been a long time
since I played most of the games the Emblems are from, but I still recognized
several of these maps! It was really cool to see these maps and hear a little
about the story of their games again. It makes me want to replay them,
especially Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn. For Sigurd and Leif's Paralogues,
I haven't played their games since they weren't released outside of Japan and I
haven't gotten around to playing the fan translation patches, but hearing the
characters talk about their adventures and seeing their maps makes me want to
play those games. It also makes me want a Genealogy of the Holy War remake or at
least an official English release! I mean, why else would they feature Emblem
Sigurd so prominently in the story if they weren't planning on bringing
Genealogy back somehow, right? ...Right?

The weapon triangle of many previous Fire Emblem games makes a return here with
an interesting new twist: the Break system. If you attack an enemy with a weapon
that has an advantage over theirs, you'll inflict Break on them, disarming them
until after their next combat. This means that they won't be able to counter you
during the combat you inflict Break, and you can also get a free attack in on
them if you attack that same turn with another unit. This can be helpful to
strategically defang tough enemies. I only played on Normal difficulty, which
was pretty easy the whole way through, but I imagine using Break effectively is
very important on the harder difficulties.

Outside of combat, the place where you'll spend the most time is at Somniel.
This is your base of operations throughout the game, and between chapters you
can return here to run around the area, talk to your allies, eat meals with
them, and play a few mini-games, including fishing, a wyvern rail shooter, and
several strength training games. The gameplay here is a little like Three
Houses' Garreg Mach Monastery in that you're exploring this 3D home base in
3rd-person, but other than that it's actually more like a new version of My
Castle from Fates. Characters in your army will appear around Somniel to talk
to, but only some of them will ever have anything related to the story to say.
Most of the time they just have generic character dialogue, which can be fun too
although I was much less likely to talk to them towards the end of the game
since I knew they'd just be repeating dialogue I'd already heard before. The
last thing I want to mention about Somniel is your pet/mascot, Sommie. He's this
cute little creature that follows you around Somniel, and his footsteps make
this adorable squishy noise. Plus, you get to dress him up, and I love that
you can give him a little Alear wig, it's too funny!

Characters in this game come off as pretty one-note most of the time. They each
have their "thing," and that's what a lot of their dialogue and supports will
center around. Initially, I was a little thrown off by the simplicity of the
characters. They felt too flat. Many of their Supports tend to revolve around
their main character trait and nothing else. Céline has multiple C Support
conversations about tea, and I saw two of them in a row at one point. In fact, a
lot of the Supports between Firenese characters are about tea, and they're the
first characters you get so Supports at the beginning of the game weren't super
interesting. But after awhile, the characters really began to grow on me. Their
simple personality traits became endearing, and many of their Supports became
more interesting too, like Alcryst's Supports with Céline about their shared
fear of losing their older brothers. Alcryst has several good supports, I think
on average his supports might be the best ones in the game, at least from what I
saw. My main point here is that if you give Engage a try and you're not enjoying
the characters, give them a chance. You might find that your opinion on them
turns around later on like mine did, but even if it never does I think it's
worth sticking it out for the gameplay alone.

One other thing about the characters in this game, a lot of them have really odd
quirks. Some of it is just overexaggerated anime cheese, particularly early on,
but then you have things like Clanne's weird obsession with pickles. This comes
up in his C Support with Etie, and when I saw this Support, I was like "what is
happening right now?" I was similarly thrown by Yunaka's introduction, where she
says things like "Zappy!" and "hiya papaya!" which come off really forced and
awkward, but I guess that's kind of the point there, and she actually ended up
becoming one of my favorite characters. Some of the quirks can be endearing at
times, like Chloé's love of disgusting-sounding folk food dishes. Overall, I
really did end up liking the characters, at least the ones I ended up using.
Although with Alfred it was kind of a love-hate relationship, because his quotes
like "My muscles are yours!" still got on my nerves at the end of the game, and
he didn't turn out to be a very good unit either. He was pretty much carried by
Emblem Sigurd, the absolute chad. I would have stopped using Alfred, but I'd
already put so much time into training him and he was in a lot of story
cutscenes so I felt obligated to keep him in my party.

Playing this game felt incredibly nostalgic, largely due to the Emblems but the
mechanics were also much more like classic Fire Emblem. I can definitely see
myself replaying it at some point. There's so many characters I didn't use, so
much potential for team building through class changes using Second Seals, and
pairing different Emblems with different characters opens up a lot of
possibilities too. It's a very different game than Three Houses, its
predecessor, and it leaves me wondering which direction the series will go in
the future. Will the next game feature more social sim elements like Three
Houses, or will it have the more traditional gameplay loop of Engage? Or, maybe
they'll continue with both types of games, alternating styles between releases.
I really enjoyed both Three Houses and Engage, so I don't mind either way, but I
imagine some fans might prefer one or the other. Anyway, if you're a fan of the
series or of strategy RPGs in general, I definitely recommend checking Engage
out. It could also be a good starting point if you've never played a Fire Emblem
game before too. You won't have any nostalgia for the Emblems, but seeing them
might be enough to get you interested in playing some of the older games. My
final time was 51 hours 38 minutes. A large chunk of that was cutscenes and time
spent in Somniel, but I also completed every Paralogue, so if you just focus on
the main story you could probably finish the game much faster.
