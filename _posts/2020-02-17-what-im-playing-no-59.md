Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a

### Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore *(Switch)*    {#TokyoMirageSessionsFEEncore}

I finished chapters 3 and 4 this week, and did a whole slew of side quests as
well!

<figure class="half center">

</figure>

The chapter boss of chapter 3 gave me a bit of trouble. My characters were
probably underleveled, but I didn't want to go back and grind so I just kept
trying despite getting a few Game Overs in a row. Eventually, my team took down
the boss and just *barely* survived! Immediately afterward, our newest party
member joined: Mamori, the axe-wielding knight of the group.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BXNEL8Y.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BXNEL8Ym.jpg" alt="Mamori"/></a>
</figure>

Once again, I completed a number of side quests between chapters. One involved
hunting down some donuts that Tiki wanted, only to find out she can't eat them
since she can't interact with the human world. Another had Tsubasa learning how
to flirt from a cat, and in the first side quest for Mamori, Itsuki helped her
gain confidence so she could perform better on her cooking show, Microwavin'
with Mamorin.

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/uIEWWAm.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uIEWWAmm.jpg" alt="Microwavin' with Mamorin"/></a>
</figure>

After that, I made my way onward to chapter 4, which naturally meant another
Mirage-related incident and a new Idolasphere dungeon to explore. The first
mini-boss of the dungeon didn't result in any Game Overs for me, but it did
require some careful strategy. The catch here was you had to defeat all three
enemies before they had a chance to revive themselves. When one of their turns
rolls around, they'll always use their turn to revive their fallen allies if
you've taken one or two down. I used a balance of area-of-effect attacks like
Mazio and SP Skills, and managed to defeat them all at the same time.

</figure>

A few new crafting mechanics were also introduced during my playtime this week.
I can now craft stronger versions of previous weapons, provided the character
has mastered all the weapon skills and I have the required crafting ingredients.
The main benefit of this that I can see is that the character will re-learn all
the same skills from the weapon, allowing you to power up your favorite skills
further.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/svw0gRo.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/svw0gRom.jpg" alt="stronger versions"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FmwrIEZ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FmwrIEZm.jpg" alt="the weapon"/></a>
</figure>

The other new mechanic is Class Change for the main cast's Mirages. This
requires a Master Seal, which you get from bosses or treasure chests, and just
like in the Fire Emblem series it allows you to change into the Advanced Classes
that the game has to offer. I used a few of these, and first changed Chrom into
the Conqueror class. I could have chosen the Great Lord class instead, but I
went with Conqueror because I liked the higher HP, attack, and defense stats it
granted. After I got more Master Seals, Tharja class changed to Sorcerer, Caeda
class changed to Falcon Knight, Virion class changed to Sniper, and Cain class
changed to Paladin.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

Another big advancement I made this week was having several of my team members
learn the Radiant Skill "Open Audition", which allows them to perform Session
attacks even when they're not in the active party during battle. Now that a few
of my party members have this skill, I can get long Session combos that I
couldn't get before! Getting these long Session combos really whittles down
regular enemies' HP quickly, and it definitely helps against bosses too!

[![chapter 4 boss](https://i.imgur.com/OopsjOMm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/OopsjOM.jpg)
{: .image-right }

The remainder of chapter 4 wasn't too difficult, though after my first Game Over
to the second mini-boss I did spend some time grinding in the bonus EXP dungeon
to level up my party by a few levels. This made a *big* difference, and my next
attempt at the mini-boss went much better. Plus, when I reached the chapter boss
I was able to beat them on my first attempt!

At the end of chapter 4, Yashiro joins the team to less than enthusiastic
reception. He's pretty good in battle though. He's basically a Myrmidon from
Fire Emblem, and he's got a Counter skill which baits the enemy into attacking
him to prevent damage and counterattack their physical attacks. With Yashiro on
the team, I'm pretty sure I've got a full party. At least, it doesn't seem like
there's any more room for characters on the menu screen!

<figure class="third">

Now that I've completed 4 chapters, I believe I'm a little over halfway through
the game. I'm still enjoying it a lot! I love the quirkiness of it, the fun
characters, and the incredibly fun battle mechanics continue to hold my
interest.

### Advance Wars *(GBA)*    {#AdvanceWars}

I finished the remainder of the Campaign. One of the late game maps took me a
long time to overcome, but eventually I was victorious! The rank I got for that
one was low, as expected, but hey, a victory is a victory.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gREJZ81.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gREJZ81m.png" alt="a long time"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/O6JVQBg.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O6JVQBgm.png" alt="low"/></a>
</figure>

The end of Campaign sees you finally confronting the true enemy: Sturm. This
mission was pretty cool, in that it's a 3-on-1 fight against Sturm. You control
Andy, Grit, and Sami. You basically get 3 turns in a row, controlling each of
their armies sequentially.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/U13b0y8.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/U13b0y8m.png" alt="Sturm"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/psDaNVL.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/psDaNVLm.png" alt="Grit"/></a>
</figure>

Sturm is no slouch though, and he put up a fierce opposition, even outnumbered
like this. His CO Power, Meteor Strike, is also super powerful. It hits an area
of the map and reduces the units it hits down to 2 HP. Despite these challenges,
I eventually gained the upper hand and claimed victory. Sturm escapes after the
battle though, and vows that he will return...which is exactly what he does in
Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. Anyway, with that the campaign is over.
Overall, I did alright on it, earning a B Rank.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qLYAK7j.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qLYAK7jm.png" alt="Meteor Strike"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PqzRSUW.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PqzRSUWm.png" alt="B Rank"/></a>
</figure>

After beating the regular Campaign, you can unlock the Advance Campaign by
purchasing it from the Battle Maps store. It consists of the same missions and
story as the original Campaign, but with more difficult maps. I'm not planning
on trying it out though, I'm fine with the vanilla Campaign experience
personally! I really enjoyed playing through Advance Wars' campaign, it was a
nice blast from the past for me seeing how much time I put into Advance Wars
Dual Strike so many years ago.

### The Sims 4 *(PC)*    {#TheSims4}

After a long time away from it, I returned to my save in The Sims 4 to continue
the adventures of my vampiric global superstar sim, Kaleigh Covarrubias!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GflRcFL.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GflRcFLm.png" alt="global superstar"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2md3CWE.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2md3CWEm.png" alt="Kaleigh Covarrubias"/></a>
</figure>

First off, a new Stuff Pack has released since the last time I played. Tiny
Living Stuff adds a number of new items to help you build fully featured homes
that are extremely small. You can get various bonuses depending on just how
small your home is. It sounds like an interesting concept, but it's one I didn't
explore *at all* this week. I was still focused on finishing up the journey
Kaleigh started with the release of the previous Expansion Pack: attending
university.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/E4uDe2o.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/E4uDe2om.png" alt="Tiny Living Stuff"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3qfjo7U.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3qfjo7Um.png" alt="various bonuses"/></a>
</figure>

Kaleigh was still in her first term at university when I began, so she had a
long way to go. She was pursuing a degree in the culinary arts, because I
thought the idea of a vampire studying to be a chef was hilarious. I still think
it's pretty amusing! She lived in the dorms during her first term, with a bunch
of other sims, but this got old *really* quickly for me. The other sims at
university seem to leave trash all over the place and always smell bad, and with
so many of them living in the dorm, things got out of hand quickly. The only
good memory I have of that dorm is the time I had Kaleigh use the "Pretend to
Bite" interaction on her roommate. It was a fun bonding experience for both of
them, I'm sure!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XDnyKA5.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XDnyKA5m.png" alt="Pretend to Bite"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/d4U9bTW.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d4U9bTWm.png" alt="fun bonding experience"/></a>
</figure>

For her second term, which began immediately after the first, I moved Kaleigh
out of the dorms and into a different university housing building. This one
wasn't a dormitory, and had only 2 bedrooms with 2 beds each. It's a lot I
downloaded from the Gallery that PatronusLight had recommended, and it was
really nice! It had plenty of computers and tables for all the students to do
their coursework.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/q3eZ12j.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/q3eZ12jm.png" alt="different university housing building"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8fDNtUM.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8fDNtUMm.png" alt="it was really nice"/></a>
</figure>

Living in a smaller space with fewer roommates meant it was easier for me to get
to know the other sims Kaleigh was living with. I never learned any of their
names, but I didn't get sort of attached to them while they lived there. They
were definitely an interesting bunch. For starters, there was the one belonged
to some sort of cult and always looked like she was up to something. Then there
was Kaleigh's roommate, who always seemed to be sleeping. One guy was eating
food all the time. Lastly, they actually wound up with a 5th roommate that term,
since I added a coffin for Kaleigh to hibernate in, but still had her claim a
bed. That poor 5th sim was forced to sleep on the couches since there wasn't a
bed for him to use!

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WDmXqsP.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WDmXqsPm.png" alt="forced to sleep on the couches"/></a>
</figure>

Unfortunately, it wouldn't take long before disaster struck. Prior to enrolling
in university, Kaleigh had a hired maid that came everyday to clean her house.
Well, apparently when she left for university, the maid came along with her to
clean the dorm each day. The maid was an elderly gentleman. That's important,
because on one of the first days of Kaleigh's 2nd term, he died of old age in
the living room. Kaleigh and her roommate mourned for a bit, and then I put his
urn on a nearby desk and forgot about him. A few days passed without incident,
but then his ghost came out one night to cause some mischief. He broke both
sinks in the bathroom and 2 of the 3 showers. His ghost wasn't all bad though,
sometimes he just chilled on the couch.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NUonInB.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NUonInBm.png" alt="he died of old age"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IfgpJFA.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IfgpJFAm.png" alt="sometimes he just chilled on the couch"/></a>
</figure>

Aside from completing homework and writing papers, I also had Kaleigh join the
Debate Guild on campus. It was sort of cool to have her be involved in a
university organization, but the highlight of it for me were the Debate
Showdowns that occurred once per term. Kaleigh changed into her club outfit each
time, and won debates like a champ. It was a cool little event, and though I'm
not sure if it has any long term benefit, I'm glad she participated. Plus, they
also had scheduled team hangout times where they all bonded over juice pong.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/64jj8OH.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/64jj8OHm.png" alt="won debates"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Jx3CA16.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jx3CA16m.png" alt="juice pong"/></a>
</figure>

Eventually, Kaleigh reached the end of the 4th and final term, and it was time
for graduation. The graduation ceremony is pretty anticlimactic, your sim just
disappears inside the building where they go for classes for a while. But they
change into graduation cap and gown for it, so that's pretty cool. Kaleigh ended
with a 4.0 GPA, which was pretty easy to get actually, but I suspect that's
largely due to the fact that Kaleigh didn't need to sleep since she's a vampire,
and I could have her work on coursework all night with no negative
repercussions. Leaving university, I moved Kaleigh back in with Celeste and
Bret, the roommates she'd lived with prior to beginning the path of higher
education. Now that she's obtained her degree in culinary arts, I think it's
time to get her started in a career as a 5 star chef!

### Hollow Knight *(PC)*    {#HollowKnight}

I began my Hallownest adventures this week by exploring The White Palace. This
area was focused on platforming, and demanded some intense precision. Many of
the rooms were filled with spinning saw blades that quickly moved back and
forth, so I had to time my jumps around those. It would have been very difficult
to complete this area if not for the Hiveblood charm. This charm allows you to
regenerate 1 HP if you avoid taking damage for a few seconds after being hurt.
Since all the damage here is dealt by spikes and you reset on safe ground after
touching them, Hiveblood basically guaranteed that I would never run out of HP
during the platforming challenges as long as I was patient and let my health
regenerate. After getting damaged by spikes and saw blades many times, I
eventually made it to the end of the White Palace to claim my prize: the
Kingsoul.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/kngGkCl.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kngGkClm.jpg" alt="The White Palace"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dW9MmuT.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dW9MmuTm.jpg" alt="spinning saw blades"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/j4xg104.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/j4xg104m.jpg" alt="the Kingsoul"/></a>
</figure>

The Kingsoul is a powerful Charm in its own right, but I was interested in it
mainly because it unlocks a new hidden area of the Abyss. Having the Kingsoul
let me reach the Knight's birthplace, deep in the Abyss. After a flashback, you
unlock Void Heart. This replaces the Kingsoul charm, and having it in your
possession unlocks new endings.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DTvZznT.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DTvZznTm.jpg" alt="birthplace"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/fKJc6bt.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fKJc6btm.jpg" alt="Void Heart"/></a>
</figure>

After getting the Void Heart, Hornet appears outside the Black Egg Temple. Now
when you enter the battle against the Hollow Knight, after you've damaged it
enough Hornet will appear and restrain it. This allows the Knight to strike with
the Dream Nail, and confront the source of the Infection inside the Hollow
Knight.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ai4H3Bi.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ai4H3Bim.jpg" alt="Hornet appears outside the Black Egg Temple"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BIIIA26.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BIIIA26m.jpg" alt="Hornet will appear and restrain it"/></a>
</figure>

The source of that Infection is The Radiance. The Radiance is the real enemy
behind the Hollow Knight's actions, and the true threat to Hallownest. It's also
another challenging boss battle! The Radiance attacks with spikes, rays of
light, and fireballs that chase you, all of which deal 2 damage per hit. I died
rather quickly on my first two attempts, and as a result had to re-fight the
Hollow Knight to get back to The Radiance battle.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZDfHXfh.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZDfHXfhm.jpg" alt="The Radiance"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Sc4JwT3.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Sc4JwT3m.jpg" alt="challenging boss battle"/></a>
</figure>

Luckily, by then I could breeze through the battle with the Hollow Knight
easily. My third try fighting Radiance, I was successful, and was treated to an
incredible scene where the Knight's body splits open, revealing the Void inside.
Meanwhile, the Void from within the Hollow Knight tears open the Radiance's
face, and you get to mash the attack button to have the Knight repeatedly attack
their now helpless foe. The Radiance is then pulled down into the Void, and
destroyed. The cutscene for this ending shows Hornet waking up in the Temple of
the Black Egg alone, with the Knight's mask lying broken nearby.

</figure>

[![return to the Void](https://i.imgur.com/DEuvLTIm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/DEuvLTI.jpg)
{: .image-right }

It's another very powerful ending. I'm amazed with how much story and lore this
game can convey with such little text. There's some room for interpretation in
the ending. Whether or not the Knight is dead isn't completely clear. I'm of the
belief that in this ending the Knight has simply changed form, losing their
physical form to return to the Void.

[![my completion rate](https://i.imgur.com/ywBtwilm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/ywBtwil.jpg)
{: .image-right }

When I got this ending, I was at 93% completion. In most metroidvanias, I would
be very happy with this amount, and leave it at that. There are very few games I
chase 100% completion for, and I've never done it for a metroidvania. But Hollow
Knight is different for me, because I just don't want to stop playing! Using the
wiki for information on what I had missed, I quickly brought my completion rate
up to 100%! Even though I leaned on the wiki heavily to do it, I'm pretty proud
I managed to get 100% completion and beat the game in under 20 hours, because
that netted me the Speed Completion Steam achievement! 100% completion doesn't
mean I've done everything Hollow Knight has to offer though. The full completion
rate is actually 112%, as I believe the extra 12% comes from the free DLC
updates that were released after the game's launch, all of which were installed
by default when I downloaded the game.

I don't think I'll be going for full 112% completion though. That would require
me to beat the all the Pantheons, which are boss rush modes introduced by one of
the aforementioned free DLCs. I did the first two to see what they were like,
and to my surprise found them very doable. But these were the easiest of the
Pantheons, and I'm sure the others offer a much higher challenge. It seems like
I'm reaching the end of my Hollow Knight experience. There's definitely more I
*could* do, but while I respect challenges like the Pantheons and Nightmare King
Grimm, I don't feel the need to overcome them myself. Growing more skilled at
the movement and combat in this game has been *so rewarding* though, I love it!
