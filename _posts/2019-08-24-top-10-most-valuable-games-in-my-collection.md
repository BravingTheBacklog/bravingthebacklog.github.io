title: Top 10 Most Valuable Games in my Collection
---

Recently I was looking through the N64, GameCube, and DS games I own, and I
wondered how much they would be worth. Not that I'm interested in selling them,
as the main reason I'm holding onto them is sentimental value, but I was
curious. I turned to PriceCharting.com to determine the top 10 most valuable
games I own!

<!--more-->

PriceCharting may not be a perfect resource, but it's definitely a convenient
one. I tracks prices of video games over time, and splits the prices into
several categories, including Loose (cartridge or disc only), CIB (Complete In
Box; game, box, and manual), and New (factory sealed packaging). Its data does
cite real completed sales from eBay, so it's not making up prices out of
nowhere. This isn't a sponsorship or anything, I've just found the website
pretty interesting to search through lately.

I thought about filtering out recent games, or games for recent platforms. In
the end though, it turned out that many of the games I own for modern systems
don't even make this list. Games for older Nintendo systems have held or
appreciated in value remarkably well. Admittedly, the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360
games PatronusLight and I own aren't worth very much at all, so you won't see
any of them on this list!

## 10. {% include game.html game="The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks" platform="" title="The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks (US$35.98)" %}

Starting off the list at number 10, we have The Legend of Zelda: Spirits Tracks.
I'll admit, I never finished this game. I'm not really sure why either. I played
through its DS predecessor, Phantom Hourglass, in its entirety, and that game
has a bit of backtracking that can be a slog to get through. For whatever reason
though, I just dropped Spirit Tracks at a certain point.

Of the two Zelda DS games, it's the more valuable. Whether or not it's better
than Phantom Hourglass is up to you!

## 9. {% include game.html game="The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Switch"  platform="" title="The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (US$36.67)"%}

As a Switch game, this entry is one of the more recent games to make this list.
What surprised me however is that PriceCharting lists its value as higher than
other more recent Switch titles I own: Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Pokémon: Let's
Go, Eevee!, and the LEGO Harry Potter Collection.

I did see the average price fluctuate for Switch Skyrim over the course of a few
days while drafting this post. It was originally a few dollars higher, putting
it at number 8, then dropped in price down to 10, and finally reached place 9 when the original number 9 (Luigi's Mansion) dropped in price!

## 8. {% include game.html game="Pokemon Colosseum" platform="" title="Pokémon Colosseum (US$40.00)"%}

The first Pokémon RPG on a home console, Pokémon Colosseum blew me away at the
time. Pokémon had never before looked this good in 3D, and I loved the region
and story. It wasn't a traditional Pokémon game, with no wild Pokémon, Routes,
or Gym Leaders, but I think it still has its charm.

## 7. {% include game.html game="Super Smash Bros. Ultimate"  platform="" title="Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (US$40.09)"%}

I've always liked Super Smash Bros., and Ultimate is no exception to this. The
huge roster including all previous fighters is pretty amazing. Now around 9
months old, the price for Ultimate has already dropped to US$40, and it'll
likely drop some more in the future. Smash Bros. is popular enough now that I
think Ultimate will be a pretty common Switch game by the of the Switch's life,
so it probably won't hold its value.

## 6. {% include game.html game="Paper Mario"  platform="" title="Paper Mario (US$43.50)"%}

A complete copy of Paper Mario is actually worth US$111.54 at this time, but all
I have is the cartridge! Sadly, when I was a kid I didn't have the foresight to
hold onto the box. Although, the cardboard N64 game boxes aren't as nice for
preservation as modern plastic game cases.

Paper Mario isn't the oldest game I own, but it is the oldest game on this list!

## 5. {% include game.html game="Fire Emblem Three Houses"  platform="" title="Fire Emblem: Three Houses (US$50.78)"%}

Three Houses is the most recent game on this list, not even a month old yet at
the time of writing. So, it's not much of a surprise to see that its price is
still close to the launch price of US$60.

## 4. {% include game.html game="Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door"  platform="" title="Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (US$55.00)"%}

Since I have a complete copy of it, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is worth
more than the N64 Paper Mario in my collection. As I've said before, it's a
phenomenal game, my favorite on the GameCube. It is one of the more expensive
GameCube games, and the most expensive GameCube game on this list.

## 3. {% include game.html game="Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon" title="Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon (US$59.26)" platform="" %}

Going into this article, I didn't realize Shadow Dragon would be one of the most
valuable games I owned. When I played this on my original DS, I thought it was
okay. It was cool to see Marth outside of Smash Bros., but I enjoyed the prior
Fire Emblem games more than this one.

I think the declining popularity of the series at the time probably led to a low
number of units being shipped. Now that Fire Emblem is popular, it's really no
surprise that the prices of older games would be driven up, I guess. I mean,
Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is listed on PriceCharting as US$120.72 for a
*disc-only copy*. I will always curse the day I lost or otherwise lent away my
copy of Path of Radiance. It was a huge mistake, and now getting a copy for my
collection is pretty unlikely given the huge price tag!

## 2. {% include game.html game="Persona Q2 New Cinema Labyrinth" title="Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth - Premium Showtime Edition (US$63.37)" image="https://i.imgur.com/60Udroj.jpg" thumb="https://i.imgur.com/60Udrojm.jpg"  platform="" %}

The 2nd most valuable on this list, and the 2nd most recent game I own, Persona
Q2's "Premium Showtime Edition" came with a number of physical goodies that I
just couldn't pass up. It has a Koromaru plush! And a set of playing cards with
Persona characters on them in their chibi Persona Q style!

The game itself isn't entirely my cup of tea. It's interesting that
PriceCharting reports its current value higher than the US$60 I purchased it
for. Honestly, I can see it becoming even more valuable in a few years. It's one
of the last big 3DS games released (maybe *the* last?) and I don't think it sold
all that well as a result. Plus, collector's editions like this are probably
more rare anyway. We'll see as time goes on, but either way I'm glad to have it
in my collection!

## 1. {% include game.html game="Persona Dancing Endless Night Collection"  platform="" title="Persona Dancing: Endless Night Collection (US$70.47)"%}

The first and only game on this list not on a Nintendo console! The Persona
Dancing: Endless Night Collection includes both Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight
and Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight. Each is a rhythm game spin-off of a
mainline Persona title. The Endless Night Collection also included a digital
download for Persona 4: Dancing All Night on PS4, the first time that game was
available on a system other than the PlayStation Vita where it originated.

Not much to say about this one. It was the most expensive on this list when I
bought it, I think it was around US$90. I don't regret the purchase, I had a lot
of fun playing both games in this compilation, but I will admit that the price
tag was a *little* high for the amount of songs included in each game. It was
worth it to see the Persona 3 cast together again though, especially in HD 3D,
and for the awesome Persona 3 music tracks and remixes!
