### Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest *(3DS)*

I finished my playthrough of Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest!

When I first made it to Chapter 27, the final chapter, I knew I was in for a
rough time. Sadly, I had lost Camilla in the prior chapter, so I created a new
save in case I needed to go back and keep her alive. So the first time I played
Chapter 27, I didn't have a full party of units. I was 2 strong units shy of a
full party. I also lost so many units beating the chapter. But I thought, "well,
it's the last chapter so its okay." Then, I beat Chapter 27...only to be
surprised by the Endgame chapter immediately afterward, with no option to save
in between! I should have known 27 wasn't the last chapter, because Fire Emblem
*always* calls the final chapter Endgame.

Knowing that the Endgame chapter was waiting for me, I replayed Chapter 27 more
carefully, and managed to beat it while only losing a few more units. Endgame
still rocked my house hard though, I needed more manpower and better
preparation! So, I loaded my Chapter 26 save. Camilla would live to see Endgame,
I swore it to myself! After a few retries of Chapter 26, I got everyone through
alive. Somehow I was able to do the same in Chapter 27. Then I got to Endgame
again.

I was still 2 characters shy of a full roster for Endgame, which probably made
things ever so slightly more difficult. But I took things step by step, and
didn't rush forward too much. In the end it wasn't that difficult, although
taking out the final boss brought down many of my units. Xander fell (he
actually was defeated by regular enemies, not the final boss), as well as Leo.
That made the avatar and Camilla the only members of the Nohr royal family to
make it through the game uninjured. Well, my Azura also made it through as well,
if she counts. I sacrificed Shura in order to break through the enemy's guard.
Sofia died. Ignatius turned out to be an extremely good Great Knight in the
final chapters, his strength and defense were super high!

Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest on Classic mode was a challenge. It pushed me to
think about strategy more often than any other Fire Emblem game. For this, it
was a lot of fun! The ending of the story in Conquest leaves some things
unexplained, with Birthright to fill in some holes and Revelations to complete
the picture. It feels a little strange due to this, but overall it's relatively
satisfying anyway.

### Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright *(3DS)*

Since I finished Conquest, I decided to move onto Birthright. Again, I'll be
playing it in Classic Mode on Normal, mostly because I used the "Branch of Fate"
option on the main menu to avoid having to play the 6 introductory missions
again. I didn't realize I couldn't change to Casual Mode when doing this, but I
don't anticipate having any issues keeping characters alive in Birthright.

[![Made a new avatar and decided to make them female](https://i.imgur.com/LblK4eLm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/LblK4eL.png)
{: .image-right }

I made a new avatar and decided to make them female this time around, and ended
up basically making Mitsuru Kirijo from Persona 3. After PatronusLight pointed
out they resembled Mitsuru, I of course had to name them that as well. The hair
color even makes sense for her since most of her Hoshidan siblings have reddish
hair!

Right off the bat, Birthright seems way easier than Conquest. The enemies in the
first Birthright mission seemed to be a lower level. You're also given many
opportunities to grind for extra experience and gold, in the form of "Challenge"
missions that seem to be available between each story mission. They haven't been
much of a challenge so far, but I'm enjoying having the time build up the
Support Links between my units. Chances are I'll get more pairs of units to S
rank in Birthright, and have access to way more Paralogue missions than I did
when playing Conquest.

### Super Smash Bros. Ultimate *(Switch)*

One of the modes I hadn't tried before this week was Mob Smash. I tried out the
Century Smash option, where the goal is defeat 100 fighters as fast as you can!
The majority of them are Mii fighters, but occasionally there's an actual
fighter thrown into the mix. All of them get sent flying very easily, but you
still only have one life so every percent of damage you take makes your pulse
race. It was a pretty fun mode, I played it as Chrom and completed it in under 4
minutes!

My goal of completing Classic Mode as each of the characters from the original
N64 Smash has been reached! Surprisingly, I think Jigglypuff's Classic Mode path
was my favorite so far. Every fighter you face is from the N64 roster, and every
stage is an N64 stage!

### Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! *(Switch)*

After seeing PatronusLight play Let's Go Eevee a bit, I couldn't hold back
anymore and had to start my playthrough!

Pokémon Let's Go Eevee (along with Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu) is a remake of Gen
1's Pokémon Yellow, but with *many* updates! Seeing Kanto in 3D in this art
style is amazing. For as much as I played Gen 1 back in the day, I'd forgotten
how cool this map layout is. It's not just a straight loop or anything, there's
interconnected cities and underground tunnels. I love Kanto!

<figure class="third">

</figure>

The most notably change in these remakes is the way you encounter and catch wild
Pokémon. It's way different than in the mainline Pokémon games. You see wild
Pokémon appear on the field rather than encountering them randomly when walking
through tall grass or caves. This is really cool honestly, especially when you
see an uncommon Pokémon pop up!

    </div>

</figure>

When you come into contact with a wild Pokémon, instead of going into battle
like every other Pokémon game, you go into "catching mode," I guess? You
basically throw Poké Balls until the Pokémon is captured, having to physically
make a throwing motion if playing with a Joy-Con. This throwing motion is
something I'm *really* bad at, for whatever reason. I'm constantly missing or
just dropping Poké Balls! Luckily you get *tons* of Poké Balls for free.
Trainers will give you extras when you beat them in battle, and you start the
game with 50 Poké Balls! PatronusLight and I had a real laugh over how bad I am,
because she's had no issues so far with these mechanics in her playthrough!

</figure>

When I tried catching Pokémon in tablet mode with the Joy-Cons docked, I found
it to be much easier since you just press a button to throw the Poké Ball. Even
though I'm bad the throwing motion, the catching mechanic is still sort of fun.
It can be frustrating when a Pokémon is moving around a lot. Since these are
spinoff games, and not meant to be mainline entries in the series, I'm fine with
the different catching mechanics. If you told me Pokémon was always going to be
like this moving forward, well then we'd probably have a very different
conversation. But as it stands, I think the lack of wild Pokémon battles is okay
for a spin-off like this. It also helps distance these games from the Fire Red
and Leaf Green remakes.

I defeated Brock pretty easily with my trusty Bellsprout. Once you beat him and
get the Boulder Badge, your character and Eevee exchange the cutest high five,
where Eevee high-fives you with its tail. It was adorable! They do this after
each Badge is awarded and it's amazing every time.

Onix is PatronusLight's favorite Pokémon, so I spent some time in Mt. Moon
hunting for one. One showed up surprisingly quickly and I threw several Great
Balls at, but it broke all of them. Sadly, it ran away before I could catch it.
I tried a little more, but I couldn't find a second one there. I found something
even cooler though: a shiny Geodude! I was nervous that it would run away as
well, but luckily I caught it in 2 Poké Balls!

Bellsprout handled the trainers at the Cerulean City Gym easily. Misty's team
put up a bit more of a fight, but was still a breeze for my team. Lieutenant
Surge gave me a *little* more trouble. His Raichu knew Double Kick so he was
able to land super effective hits on my Geodude, so it was quite the
straightforward fight I expected.

I kept the shiny Geodude long enough for it to evolve into a shiny
Graveller...which looks far less cool. Shortly afterward, I went through Rock
Tunnel. Onix is much more common there, and I was finally able to capture one!
Aside from being PatronusLight's favorite Pokémon, she also wanted me to have it
in my party since you can ride on its back/head! This truly is an amazing sight,
and it never gets old.

I'm currently near the end of Team Rocket's hideout in Celadon City, so that
puts me at three badges in! Returning to Kanto and replaying the gyms and story
of the first Pokémon generation has been really fun overall, and I'm looking
forward to playing it some more!
