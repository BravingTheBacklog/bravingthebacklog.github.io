Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

**Spoiler warning** for A Hat in Time, I spoil the final boss. I put this game
section last so it's easy to skip if you want to remain unspoiled.

No spoilers for either Dragon Quest VIII or SteamWorld Dig though!

### Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King *(3DS)*    {#DragonQuestVIII:JourneyoftheCursedKing}

Dragon Quest VIII provided another week of dungeon crawling and RPG goodness!
I'm still not done, but I think I can definitely sense the ending around the
corner...or at least the ending of the current plot arc. I don't know whether
another arc will follow this one or not, but I wouldn't be mad if there was
still more to go. This game just has so much charm and a great sense of
adventure!

My party acquired a ship, which opened up a bunch of new places to explore! That
freedom was initially a bit overwhelming. The enemies I found on some of the
foreign shores now available to me were a bit too much for my party. Luckily,
game overs are relatively forgiving and simply set you back to the last Church
you saved at. You're fully healed and don't lose any progress, but you do lose
50% of your gold. Eventually, I figured out where the next objective was and got
back on track following the main quest.

The hero and Jessica have both learned some pretty strong spells, like Kasizzle.
That one deals considerable fire damage to a group of enemies, making it
especially useful when dealing with one or two large groups. Yangus has also
learned the comical Underpants Dance. He dances around with pairs of boxers in
his hand when using this skill. It has a chance to cause some status ailments on
enemies, and while I've yet to see it succeed it's pretty amusing anyway!

I'm steering clear of plot spoilers, so I won't say much about the main story.
There were some slightly unexpected events, but nothing mind-blowing. The story
concept itself isn't anything special. It's serviceable, but I think the way
it's framed is what really makes it shine. That probably doesn't make any sense
out of context, but I don't want to spoil anything so I'm just going to leave it
there. Uh...enjoy some more screenshots!

### SteamWorld Dig *(PC)*    {#SteamWorldDig}

I played through this short, indie metroidvania-ish game, and really enjoyed it!
My playthrough took under 3 hours, so it really is quite short. You play as the
SteamBot Rusty, a robot who has inherited a mine from his uncle, and you set off
exploring and digging between the old mining town, Tumbleton.

</figure>

I described this game as "metroidvania-ish" since it definitely has elements of
a more traditional metroidvania, and reminds me of the formula strongly, but it
distances itself from the normal metroidvania mechanics in a few key ways.
Primarily, you spend a lot of time digging your own paths through the dirt, so
it's less exploring a pre-determined map and more like you're making your own
map. You will likely do some amount of backtracking through the tunnels you dug
earlier, as your inventory can only hold so many resources before it fills up.
Then you'll need to make your way back to the surface to sell your loot for
profit, buy upgrades, and head back down to repeat the cycle. There's less
backtracking later on as you discover teleporters and other shortcuts that can
take you back to the surface instantly, as well as the ability to buy and place
your own teleporters. There also aren't a bunch of bosses like there are in
metroidvanias, in fact the final boss is really the only one in the game. Combat
*really* isn't the focus here, and that's fine.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UlTNGWU.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UlTNGWUm.jpg" alt="buy upgrades"/></a>
</figure>

Where it feels more like a metroidvania is in the mobility and progression
upgrades you'll find in caves as you explore. These upgrades are things like a
wall jump, high jump, and a drill that lets you dig through tiles you couldn't
before.

</figure>

The gameplay loop had me hooked. Digging down into the unknown and bringing
precious metals back up to the surface to sell has a sort of Minecraft or
Terraria feel to it, and it felt very satisfying to sell off a large haul and
use the profits to buy more upgrades. There was also some element of planning
required when digging through the dirt, especially deeper down, since you need
to be careful not to get stranded without a way to get back up. If you do get
trapped, you can always self-destruct which will send you back to the surface at
the cost of 50% of your money. Dying worked the same as self-destructing, and I
did die a few times when I underestimated the monsters and hazards lurking
underground!

SteamWorld Dig is a unique game that feels great to play. I started playing it
on a whim, but I'm really glad I did! It has a sequel, and while I don't have
that one in my Steam library at the moment, I'm definitely going to be watching
for a sale and grabbing it someday!

### A Hat in Time *(PC)*    {#AHatinTime}

I finished A Hat in Time this week! I spent more time collecting Time Pieces in
the free roam world and by defeating the boss of Chapter 3. This brought my
total Time Pieces to 25, which was enough to unlock the final chapter!

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Z3yoNoQ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z3yoNoQm.jpg" alt="free roam world"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6AZIdj7.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6AZIdj7m.jpg" alt="the final chapter"/></a>
</figure>

The final chapter occurs after Mustache Girl, a character from the beginning of
the game, sneaks aboard Hat Kid's ship and steals tons of Time Pieces from the
vault. She basically uses these to alter time and make herself the ruler of the
entire world. The final level consists of some platforming challenges in
Mustache Girl's new lava-filled home before confronting and battling her. This
final fight was pretty hype. The visuals are really eye catching, the music is
super energetic, and all the characters you met along the way are there watching
you fight and cheering you on. In the end, you defeat Mustache Girl and reclaim
the Time Pieces she stole from you. Despite how large the pile of Time Pieces
you get from beating Mustache Girl is, it still only counts as one collected
Time Piece.

</figure>

And that's the end of the game! Hat Kid sets off on her journey back home, and
the credits roll. A Hat in Time was a phenomenal game. I went back to my save
after finishing the game because I was still craving more of its great 3D
platforming, and I wanted to collect a few more Time Pieces! It wasn't a
difficult game, but it was extremely charming and very fun. I'm super glad I
finally played this great indie title.
