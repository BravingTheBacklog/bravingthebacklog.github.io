### Yakuza 0 *(PC)*    {#Yakuza0}

I'm pretty sure I'm *very* close to the end of the main story. I've reached a
part where you're given a "point of no return" warning, and advised to create a
new save file if you want to keep playing from this point later. So chances are
very good that I'll finish Yakuza 0 next week!

As expected, my time with Yakuza 0 last week was filled with goofy side quests, business mini-games, and intense battles.

I didn't just get distracted by side content though, the main story also really
pulled me in. It threw me some curveballs I was not at all expecting!

I'll have more final thoughts on the game next week, presuming I've finished the
main story by then at least. Stay tuned for that!

### Luigi's Mansion 3 *(Switch)*    {#LuigisMansion3}

I finished Luigi's Mansion 3 last week! Overall, it was really fun. I enjoyed
the 2nd to last boss battle against the hotel owner, Helen Gravely, more than
the final boss battle. It required switching between both Luigi and Gooigi to
keep Luigi out of danger while shutting off power to several lasers with Gooigi,
and it was a fun balancing act.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

The final boss is King Boo, of course. It starts off easy enough, King Boo has
several different attack patterns he throws at you. I got hit by them a few
times, but then I was able to dodge most of them pretty reliably. After a few
types of attacks, he'll spawn some bombs, and you have to shoot those at him to
make him vulnerable. The first cycle like this was fine, but each time you
damage him, he spawns another clone of himself. Then you have to dodge his same
attack patterns, but with multiple King Boos launching them at once. I took a
*lot* of damage during these phases, and I especially had a hard time with the
3rd and final phase, where there are 3 King Boos attacking you. Only one is real
of course, and you have to shoot the bomb at that one, otherwise it'll just
vanish, forcing you to dodge another onslaught of attacks while waiting for the
next bombs to spawn. I had to repeat this process a lot, because I kept
panicking and missing King Boo or hitting one of the fakes. Eventually, I took
him down, saving the day and destroying the hotel in the process.

</figure>

During the credits, a nice photo montage shows everyone working with ghosts, who
are now friendly since they're no longer affected by King Boo's influence, to
construct a new building where the hotel used to stand. I can't really explain
why, but I really like credits montages like this one.

In the end, you get a ranking that is dependent on how much money you finished
the game with, and the newly constructed mansion is more extravagant the higher
your rank. I achieved a modest B Rank for my ending amount of $36,288, which I'm
happy with. The game ends with Luigi and company driving away, waving goodbye to
E. Gadd, Gooigi, and all the ghosts. There were a lot of fun puzzles throughout
Luigi's Mansion 3. Some definitely had me stumped for a while, but when you're
stuck you can pause and ask E. Gadd for help, and sometimes messages from him
will pop up automatically. This is a Switch game I'd easily recommend,
especially to anyone who enjoyed any of the other Luigi's Mansion games! I don't
think it's quite as good as the original, though it's been a long time since I
played that one. It might be a more consistent experience overall. Luigi's
Mansion 3 had a few low points, but I think the first might have had some lower
points, or more frequent lows. I guess I ought to replay the original at some
point to properly compare them!

### Shin Megami Tensei IV *(3DS)*    {#ShinMegamiTenseiIV}

I've finally started a game in the mainline Shin Megami Tensei series: Shin
Megami Tensei IV. This is something I've wanted to do for a long time, since the
Persona games began as a spin-off series to Shin Megami Tensei. So far, I'm
really enjoying it! As is tradition, I named my character Worm in an opening
sequence that don't yet understand. In it, the player character is inexplicably
flying through the air while being addressed by a deep voice. I've written it
off as a dream for now, but I imagine it might be explained in some way later
on.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/aAc6hVS.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aAc6hVSm.png" alt="I named my character Worm"/></a>
</figure>

The player character is a commoner in the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado. At an
annual festival at the capital, they partake in the Gauntlet ritual, a rite
wherein new Samurai are chosen by the mysterious Gauntlets, hi-tech devices worn
on one's forearm. The Gauntlets will accept only certain individuals as their
new wearers, and those accepted begin new lives in the capital as Samurai,
protectors of Mikado. Once inducted into the Samurai order, you meet a few other
Samurai recruits: Walter, Jonathan, and Isabeau. Shortly after that, another
revelation is dropped on you: the Samurai's true purpose is to protect Mikado
from demons.

In no time at all, your own demon-fighting training begins, and you enter the
demon-infested caverns beneath the city, Naraku. This serves as the game's first
dungeon. Dungeon exploration uses a 3rd-person camera, where you can see enemies
and attempt to slice them with your sword to perform a preemptive strike when
battle begins. Once you come in contact with an enemy, battle begins, and oh
what a wonderful turn-based battle system it is! In battle, indicators at the
top-right of the top screen show you how many actions you may perform before it
is the enemies turn. Normally, you get one action per party member, but if you
hit the enemy's weakness or land a critical hit, you'll get an extra action.
There is a limit to how many extra actions you can receive, but by taking
advantage of this system you can gain as many as double your usual number of
actions. But the same is true for the enemy as well - if they hit your weakness,
they gain another action. They're not shy about hitting you where it hurts
either. I've lost a few encounters to common enemies simply because they got the
advantage and wiped me out in a single turn. It really keeps you on your toes!
Luckily you can save anyway outside of battle, and losing all your HP doesn't
have to lead to a game over. Instead, you can pay Charon, the ferryman of the
underworld, some Macca (the game's currency) or Play Coins, and he'll return you
to the point outside of battle just before you died. His fees are pretty steep
though. I keep frequent saves, so I find I'm more inclined to reload my last
save than pay Charon Macca.

One of the most notable Shin Megami Tensei features is demon recruitment.
Persona 5 has a similar feature, but it's a bit different in Shin Megami Tensei
IV. Here, you can choose to talk with your enemies to use one of the player
character's actions in battle. Doing so initiates demon conversation, where the
demon will ask you questions and make several demands of you. If you negotiate
successfully, they'll join your party and fight alongside you in battle. These
can be anywhere from multiple choice answers to wanting to have some of your HP.
It's not always clear what the right answer to the questions is. Choosing the
wrong answer can either irritate the demon, eliminating any remaining player
actions and making it the enemy's turn, or scare them into running away. Also,
demons aren't always trustworthy. Some negotiations might seem to be going well.
You might meet several demands the demon makes, only to have them turn tail and
run afterward instead of joining you.

</figure>

Once you've recruited demons, they'll gain experience and level up as they fight
alongside you. They're not your lifelong companions though. You could, in
theory, use the same demons for the whole game, but it's much more effective to
recruit many demons and use them to create stronger ones through Fusion. Fusion
allows you to combine 2 demons in your party into a new demon. They're not
always stronger, but I usually only fuse the ones that are, or ones that have
compelling skills or resistances. You can only fuse demons whose level is equal
or less than your own, however. Occasionally, mistakes will occur during fusion,
and you'll end up with a totally different demon than you intended. This has
only happened to me once so far, and I was actually fairly happy with the
result!

Those are all the main systems of Shin Megami Tensei IV. At least, so far -
there might be more waiting for me to discover next week, it wouldn't be unheard
of for an RPG to introduce new mechanics even after the player is 20 hours into
the game! The gameplay loop is super fun here. Recruiting and levelling up
demons for your party is akin to Pokémon (daily reminder that Shin Megami Tensei
released first), and I really like it. I've enjoyed the battle systems and demon
designs in Persona before, so it's no surprise I'd enjoy SMT's similar systems.
It's also really cool seeing demons that I recognize from the Persona series,
and a lot more that I've never seen before! The narrative and setting is really
interesting too, but it takes a backseat to the gameplay and lets the player
explore freely. Not that it's non-linear, but it definitely doesn't hold your
hand and instead offers you broad goals and leaves it up to you to gather
information and figure out how to achieve them. In that regard, it reminds me a
lot of retro RPGs, but that's fine by me! I'm really interested in where the
story will go. There have been a few twists already, but I'll get more into
those next time. No spoilers, for now!
