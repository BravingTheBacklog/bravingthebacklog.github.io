Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

I only played one game last week: Bravely Default! There are no spoilers in this
week's write-up.

### Bravely Default *(3DS)*    {#BravelyDefault}

I played through a *lot* of Bravely Default this week, experiencing its twists and turns, and above all, many more of its job classes!

I'm not really sure what to write about the main story. A lot of it plays out how you might expect if you've played Final Fantasy I. You travel around the world, defeating monsters and awakening crystals at their respective temples. There are a few obstacles and detours here and there, so you're not exactly going from 1 crystal right to the next, but that's the general flow of the story...up until a plot twist that happened toward the end of my playtime this week! I'll cover that more next week, because I'm still not entirely sure what's going on!

With all the jobs available, I changed jobs on each character a few times this week. Certain combinations have been *really* good for a while, but then I've found myself having to change it up when confronted with new enemies or bosses with specific strengths and weaknesses. I was really enjoying the Salve Maker class for a while. It excels at using items, and also has the First Aid skill which will heal the party member with lowest HP at the end of the turn, and it doesn't cost any MP! The downside of that is it can only be used in battle, and if you finish the battle in less than 1 turn, you don't get any healing in, so it's not perfect. I had Tiz as a Pirate for a while, with the Dual Wield support ability he'd learned from the Ninja class. He was dealing a *ton* of damage for a while, but eventually he was missing too much so I switched him to a different class again.

One thing that's bothered me about the game recently: the difficulty of battles has *really* increased. Some enemies were KO'ing a member of my team even when they were at full health, which was super annoying. Maybe I just have bad job combinations equipped for this point of the game, but I didn't have any trouble up to this point, so the sudden difficulty increase has been a little jarring. It just seems like bosses have so much health now, it's like whacking a sponge. I loved the game up until this point, but my enjoyment has definitely been dampened a bit with the harsher battles. Maybe I should just turn the difficulty down to Easy. Either way, I'm looking forward to seeing what else Bravely Default has in store.
