In 2021, I completed 32 games. Most of them were games from the mountainous
backlog, but a few of them were 2021 releases. Cutting that list of 32 games
down into a top 10 was tough, and the games I picked are all *so* close for
me, that the ranking doesn't matter all that much anyway.

Still, there are several other games outside of my top 10 that I *really*
enjoyed, and I wanted to include those as "Honorable Mentions" too. These were
all fantastic games, and I just couldn't bring myself to leave them out of the
list entirely!

### Honorable Mentions

 - Chrono Trigger
 - The Messenger
 - Axiom Verge
 - Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow
 - Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia
 - The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds
 - Divinity: Original Sin II

With that, it's time to move on to the Top 10 Games I Played in 2021!

## 10. Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster & Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked

  </ul>

I'm starting off this top 10 with a tie between 2 games: Shin Megami Tensei III:
Nocturne HD Remaster, and Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked.

I'd never played Nocturne before, but I'd heard a lot about it. The atmosphere
and overall mood of Nocturne is incredible, and those really help make it
something special. The dungeons could be pretty brutal, but even that
contributes to its overall mood.

Devil Survivor has a really cool setting and story. I've enjoyed a few Strategy
RPGs before, so when I learned Devil Survivor was a Strategy RPG Shin Megami
Tensei spin-off, I was really curious about it. It was a really cool game, Shin
Megami Tensei mechanics like demon fusion mixed with the Strategy RPG formula
worked really well!

## 9. {% include game.html game="Shin Megami Tensei Strange Journey Redux" platform="" %}

I'm still surprised at how much I enjoyed Strange Journey Redux. This is a game
that I wasn't even that interested in at first, because I haven't cared for the
1st-person dungeon-crawlers I've played in the past all that much. But after
playing the first Shin Megami Tensei game this year to see the roots of the
series, I decided to give Strange Journey Redux a shot too, and I am so glad I
did!

I *really* enjoyed the setting here, and the characters as well. Of the Shin
Megami Tensei games I've played, this one probably makes the best use of the
alignment system, with really great alignment reps and story beats.

## 8. {% include game.html game="Shin Megami Tensei IV" platform="" %}

I liked Shin Megami Tensei IV a lot, but there's one thing that put a damper on
my enjoyment for several hours of gameplay, and that's the fact that I ended up
on the Neutral route in my playthrough, which meant I had to jump through some
*incredibly* tedious hoops in order to finish the game. That definitely brought
down the experience for me, and I very nearly didn't even finish my playthrough.
I'm glad I stuck with it and finished the game, but *wow* was that part
annoying.

Aside from that, Shin Megami Tensei IV was an excellent playthrough, and it's a
game I definitely want to return to someday to do other routes. The OST is
*phenomenal* too, and the track "Tokyo" is one of my favorite tracks in all of
SMT.

## 7. Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga 1 & 2

    <li>Developer: Atlus</li>
    <li>Release: April 5, 2005 & October 3, 2005</li>
    <li>Platform: PlayStation 2</li>
  </ul>
</figure>

Okay, this is another slot with 2 games in it *but* in this case there's a
better reason for it, because Digital Devil Saga 1 and 2 are basically one game
split into 2 parts. The 2nd game directly continues the story, and leads up to
an incredible finale.

The two are pretty interesting Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs. They basically take
the traditional party-based JRPG formula, and add some SMT flair to it, and the
result is a really good pair of games. Some SMT staples like demon fusion and
recruitment are *not* present here, but the story is *so* good here, and the
OSTs of both games are, again, just phenomenal. Plus, even though you can't
recruit them, the enemies you fight are still demons from the SMT series, and I
love that!

## 6. {% include game.html game="Gravity Rush 2" platform="" %}

I enjoyed Gravity Rush Remastered when I played it last year, and Gravity Rush 2
basically takes everything its predecessor does, and makes it bigger and better.
The highlight here for me is the gravity shifting mechanic. Shifting gravity to
fall upwards through the air, or slide up the side of a skyscraper is so cool!

On top of that, Gravity Rush 2 has a built-in photo mode of sorts, giving Kat a
camera and tripod you can use to take pictures as you fly around this open
world. I love taking screenshots, so having this mode in Gravity Rush made it
just that much better for me.

This game also answers at least *some* of the questions I was left with after
the first game's conclusion, which was nice. It's a little sad we'll probably
never get a Gravity Rush 3, but at least we got some closure with Gravity
Rush 2.

## 5. {% include game.html game="Metroid Dread" platform="" %}

I think I'm still feeling some of the disbelief I felt when Metroid Dread was
first announced during the E3 2021 Nintendo Direct. Despite Metroid: Samus
Returns having released back in 2017, I had very little hope Nintendo would
ever continue the series. I am so glad I was wrong!

Metroid Dread was fantastic. It's tough as nails during its boss fights, but
finally taking down each boss was a great feeling because of it. It's also
really good at guiding you the right direction without feeling too linear, and
there are sequence breaking opportunites for players who master the mechanics.
I'm definitely not one of those players, but I have tried some of the easier
sequence breaks, and it's really cool that sequence breaking is possible!

## 4. {% include game.html game="Bloodstained Ritual of the Night" platform="" %}

When I started playing Bloodstained, I had no idea it would make it so high up
on this list, but the game is just *so* fun. It's a wonderful revival of many of
the concepts I enjoy from the Castlevania series. It's like Symphony of the
Night with the Souls system of Aria of Sorrow added to it, and that is an
excellent combination.

Aside from that, playing Bloodstained in 2021, there's just *so* much content in
it. On top of having a New Game+ mode, it also has a built in speedrunning mode,
*and* a randomizer. The randomizer especially is interesting to me, because it
adds so much replay value if you enjoyed Bloodstained and are looking for a
different experience on repeat playthroughs.

As if all of that wasn't enough, there's also a Classic mode that pays tribute
to the NES Castlevania games. All these things make Bloodstained an incredible
revival of the Castlevania series, and I'm so glad I got around to playing it
this year.

## 3. {% include game.html game="Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse" platform="" %}

The MegaTen fanbase is pretty divided on Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse, but
I found myself solidly in the Apocalypse-enjoyers camp.

Gameplay-wise, Apocalypse is a lot like SMT IV with some tweaks and polish in a
few areas. I thought the changes to Hama and Mudo were particularly interesting,
where they'll only insta-kill if the caster is Smirking. Otherwise, they're just
damage-dealing attacks.

The story is where Apocalypse gets a lot more criticism. It's definitely *very*
different from the stories in other SMT games I've played, with a lot more focus
on anime tropes and the power of friendship. I liked it, but I understand why people
wouldn't enjoy the story.

The final boss of Apocalypse is one of my favorites in the MegaTen series. It's
a *super* epic fight with really good final boss music and a cool gimmick, and
that's all I'll say to avoid spoilers!

## 2. {% include game.html game="Persona 5 Scramble The Phantom Strikers" platform="" %}

I'm a fan of Persona 5, so I was pretty excited when Persona 5 Strikers was
announced, and I was even more excited to play it when it came out. I've never
played any other Dynasty Warrior-type games like this, so I wasn't sure if I'd
enjoy it or be any good at the gameplay. Well, I don't know if I was any good,
but I didn't have much trouble beating the game on Normal, and I had an absolute
*blast* doing so.

Strikers raised the bar for Persona spin-off games in a big way. I'm not saying
the other spin-offs are bad, I actually like the Persona dancing games a lot,
but Strikers not only has fun gameplay and a full story, but it manages to do
that while also featuring several mechanics from the original game. I'm mostly
talking about how it has demon fusion, because that was an awesome feature to
have. But it also has All Out Attacks, and other things like that to make it
feel more like a sequel to the original game.

The last thing I want to say about Strikers is that this is the only game I got
the Platinum for this year. I wanted to see *everything* it had to offer, and it
doing that was a blast!

## 1. {% include game.html game="Shin Megami Tensei V" platform="" %}
 
There's probably some recency bias with this one since it's still so fresh in my
mind, but I think Shin Megami Tensei V was the most fun I've had with a game all
year. Out of all the Shin Megami Tensei games on this list, I think V has the
weakest story, but what carries it to number 1 is that in addition to the
glorious Press Turn battles, it also has super fun exploration. I loved running
around the Netherworld, getting loot from vending machines,and seeing Fafnirs
flying around in the overworld, seeing other demons in the overworld was cool
too of course, I just especially remember the Fafnirs.

As with SMT IV, Shin Megami Tensei V is definitely a game I want to revisit at
some point to play another route, and get pulled into its excellent gameplay
loop of exploring the Netherworld and fighting its demonic residents.

That's it for the list, thanks for reading! Even though most of my gaming time
this year was spent catching up on the backlog, I was still able to play several
2021 releases.

2021 was a great year for video games, and there are still a number of
interesting releases (Deathloop, Scarlet Nexus, NEO TWEWY, Tales of Arise) I
didn't have a chance to pick up this year. I think the biggest one among those
is Tales of Arise. I've played most of the series from Tales of Symphonia
onward, and I've heard a *lot* of praise for Arise online, so I'll definitely be
checking it out eventually. If I pick it up in 2022, maybe you'll see it in next
year's top 10, who knows?
