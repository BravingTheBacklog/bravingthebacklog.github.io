### Persona 4 Arena Ultimax *(PC)*    {#Persona4ArenaUltimax}

Persona 4 Arena released for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2012. It's a fighting game
spin-off of the Persona series, and serves as a sequel of sorts to both Persona
3 and Persona 4. I bought and played the PS3 version several years ago, and it
was a pretty fun game. I knew it had a sequel on the same platforms, but I never
got around to picking it up at the time. Fast forward to 2022, and that sequel,
Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, just released on PS4, Switch, and PC. I picked it up on
Steam and finally gave it a try after all this time!

This game is a direct sequel to Persona 4 Arena, with the story beginning the
very day after the events of the first game. Luckily, the full story mode of the
first game is included in this release if you haven't played it or need a
refresher. Since it's been so long since I played the first game, my memory of
it is pretty hazy at this point. But I remembered the gist of it, and luckily
the story of Ultimax doesn't rely too much upon the details of its predecessor,
so it's fine to go in with vague idea of the first game's plot. The story is
told visual novel style, split into chapters where you'll see dialogue between
the characters, sometimes a full screen illustration or two, fight a battle, and
then the cycle repeats. All the dialogue during the chapters is fully voiced,
with only the characters' internal monologues limited to text-only. Many of the
original English voice actors of the characters return as well, which I really
appreciated. One of the returning voice actors is Vic Mignogna, the voice of
Junpei Iori from Persona 3, which I really appreciated because he has a
distinctive voice, and he also voiced Edward Elric in the English dub of both
Full Metal Alchemist and Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood!

The story is comprised of 3 "episodes," each of which follows a different main
cast. They all fit loosely around the same narrative, just with different
characters for some scenes and some events happening differently. The story in
each one was pretty enjoyable. The characters didn't get a *ton* of character
development, but there were still some nice character arcs in some of the story
routes. One of the story routes was paid DLC in the original release, but it's
included in this version, which is nice.

Since this is a fighting game, I should probably talk about the actual
*fighting* about now. I've played *very* little of traditional fighting games in
the past. My history with the genre consists of some Soul Calibur II on
GameCube, Persona 4 Arena, and then the Super Smash Bros. series, which is
*pretty* different from a traditional fighting game like this one, so it doesn't
really help me here. The basics are easy enough to pick up, but with a high
skill ceiling for those willing to really learn it. You have four different
kinds of basic attacks - weak attacks, strong attacks, weak Persona attacks, and
strong Persona attacks. There's more options available by pressing different
combinations of buttons at the same time, and that's how you do things like
throws or special attacks that cost HP to use. I'm definitely not very good at
this kind of game, but I enjoyed Persona 4 Arena in the past, and after playing
through the tutorial in Ultimax, I was able to hold my own in the story mode
battles more or less. It helps that the difficulty of the AI in story mode seems
to be *very* low, and until the final boss battle I don't think I ever lost a
match during the story. I later learned that you can change the difficulty of
the Story mode in the menus, and apparently it starts on Normal, but it always
felt easier than Arcade Mode's Normal difficulty to me.

I played a bit of Arcade mode too, and there you get to select a difficulty
ranging from Safety all the way up to Risky. I started on Easy mode, just one
step up from Safety, and that was a good fit for my skill level. Although, I was
able to make it through Arcade on Normal mode too by the end of my time with
Ultimax, so I must have improved a bit! My strategy is pretty simple - I try to
find easy combos, and just execute those repeatedly. I struggle a bit whenever
the enemy starts a combo against me. You can guard by holding the directional
input away from your opponent, but I only remember to do that sometimes, and if
they break through that with a grab or low attack I don't do a very good job of
recovering or breaking out of their combo. Still, I had fun studying the move
lists for each character and trying to execute some of button combos for their
special attacks. I'm not very accurate at the directional inputs for those, so I
often wind up doing a few regular attacks before I get the special.

Some special attacks can only be used if you have enough SP saved up, which you
gain by landing attacks on the opponent. These are flashier, and when I
remembered they existed it was always satisfying to use them against my
opponent. There's also an auto-combo feature built in, where if you basically
mash the weak attack button several times against the enemy, you'll do a basic
simple combo ending in a skill, including one of the skills that costs SP
provided you have enough when doing the auto-combo. I tried not to rely on this
*too* much since I wanted to learn the game on a basic level at least, but I
definitely fell back into using auto-combos several times throughout my battles.

That about wraps up my experience with Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. There's a lot to
this game I didn't touch, most notably the online multiplayer. Maybe I'll try it
someday just to see how badly I get crushed. I really enjoyed the modes I played
though, and I may go back and play more Arcade mode at some point. If you're a
hardcore fan of either Persona or fighting games, this game is definitely worth
playing. I think you can guess which of those camps I fall into! My final time
for this one was 19 hours 54 minutes.
