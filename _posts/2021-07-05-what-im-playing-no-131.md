Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

There is a *minor* **spoiler** for the end of Digital Devil Saga 1 in this
week's post, and by its very nature as a sequel, screenshots and discussion of
Digital Devil Saga 2 may spoil parts of the first game. But other than that, my
coverage is spoiler-free this week!

### Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga 2 *(PS2)*    {#ShinMegamiTensei:DigitalDevilSaga2}

The logical next step after finishing Digital Devil Saga 1: playing Digital
Devil Saga 2, and that's exactly what I started doing this week! It picks up
right where the first game left off, with the opening animation showing a bit of
how the cast of the first game was separated after going through the pillar of
light in the Junkyard. Serph, Argilla, and Gale, find each other quickly, and
you begin the game controlling the 3 of them as they explore an underground city
and try to make sense of where they are and what's going on.

Unfortunately, it seems what the group was told about Nirvana was a lie - the
world they find themselves in now is anything but a paradise. The surface is a
wasteland, and the sun has gone black, turning anyone its rays touch into stone.
Those with the power to transform into demons are safe from its power, which
includes the main party and also the soldiers of the Karma Society, the main
antagonists of this game. The Karma Society refers to those who can turn into
demons as Tuners, and they're not too happy when Serph and friends show up with
this power and begin fighting against them. Especially since Serph and his
friends are also fighting to protect the ordinary humans of the underground
city, who have become the primary food source of the Karma Society's demonic
soldiers.

[![The story](https://i.imgur.com/aKF1B7zm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/aKF1B7z.jpg)

The story has already shed a *lot* of light and backstory on the events of the
first game, but I won't spoil that here. All I'll say is it's really good, even
though I *still* don't fully understand aspects of it. I'm hoping it will all
become clear before the end though!

As for the gameplay, it's unsurprisingly very similar to the first game. The 2
games did release only about 5 months apart in Japan. Still, there are a few
adjustments and even quality of life improvements. The Mantra System is back,
but instead of being displayed as a basic skill tree, it's now represented as a
hexagonal grid, and you can unlock some special sets of skills or permanent stat
boosts for the party by mastering all the tiles around a locked tile.

There's also the new Berserk Battle mechanic. When you get into a battle when
the "solar noise" is high, something that increases and decreases as you walk
around, your team may go into Berserk mode. This is when their demonic power
overwhelms them, leaving them only half transformed, unable to cast spells, and
with lower defense. But their attack power is *way* higher, and they deal a lot
of critical hits. Winning a Berserk Battle results in a lot more experience
gained. It's not a radically game changing mechanic or anything, but it is kind
of cool, and the extra experience is nice when it these battles trigger.

One especially memorable moment occurs in one of the early dungeons in the game.
It's a prison where humans are held and processed into food. The warden here is
a powerful Tuner who transforms into the demon Kumbhanda. You're told he's
really strong prior to ever meeting him, and then when you do meet him, a battle
is triggered. He attacks you a bit, hitting you *really* hard but not killing
you, and then just casts his unique Dark Bind skill on you to immobilize the
team, capturing you and putting you in a cell. You're broken out of jail almost
immediately, but then the fun begins: the warden actually chases you down after
you escape. Like, I wasn't expecting him to actually run around the dungeon
after me, but *he does*! If he catches you, you just get sent back to the jail
cell and have to start the section over, but I found myself feeling really tense
here, especially when I made it to my destination with the warden right on my
tail. It was a really cool segment to see in a JRPG like this, it mixes up the
gameplay in a unique way and helped keep things fresh.

That's about it for Digital Devil Saga 2 for now. I've done *many* dungeons
after that prison one, and those have been fun too, full of battles with
familiar SMT demons as well as ones I had not seen before playing this game.
I'll probably give more thoughts on how the first and second games compare after
I finish both, but I'd say they're about equal gameplay-wise, and as far as
narrative they're also both strong, but in different ways. The first game is
interesting because of the unique world, atmosphere, and sense of mystery, while
the second game is interesting because of the characters and developing plot.
