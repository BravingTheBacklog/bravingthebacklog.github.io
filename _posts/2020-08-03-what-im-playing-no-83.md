### Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town *(Switch)*    {#StoryofSeasons:FriendsofMineralTown}

I'm in the middle of my first winter now. I don't think you can grow any crops
in this game during winter...although I guess I haven't checked the store to see
if he's selling any new seeds. My fields are snowed over and the tilled soil is
gone, so I'm doubtful. The lake surrounding the winter cave is frozen over
though, which means there's a new cave to explore. I had one long excursion in
it where I made it pretty far down by saving at the start of each floor, finding
the ladder down, and reloading the save. Since I know where the ladder is after
I reload, I save a lot of energy by not having to till tiles with the hoe to
guess where the ladder might be. Exploring the cave isn't that enjoyable for me,
so I haven't spent much time in it since then. It might be the best way to earn
money in winter by selling the gems and minerals you find, but I still have
enough money left from the Fall harvest to make it by.

In other news, the foal you receive early in the game has finally grown into an
adult horse. It's so fast! I've been riding it around pretty much everywhere
now.

I tried giving some of the items I had on hand as gifts to some of the
townspeople. Lillia was unappreciative of my generous gift of Red Grass. She
called it gross, and if I'd had the option to respond I would have called her
gross right back. Doctor was equally unreceptive to my kindness when I gifted
him lumber, but he was way more polite about it than Lillia.

### Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection *(PS4)*    {#Uncharted:TheNathanDrakeCollection}

This is a collection of the first 3 Uncharted games. They originally released
for PlayStation 3, but have been ported to PlayStation 4 with various
improvements. Having not played any of the series on PS3, this was the perfect
game for me to get into the series, and I played through Uncharted 1 & 2 this
week.

Naturally, I started with the first game: Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. The story
follows Nathan Drake, an adventurer, treasure seeker, and gunslinger. His
character is pretty similar to Indiana Jones in a number of ways. He seems to
seek out ancient artifacts for personal gain, but quickly falls into the role of
the hero due to his desire to help those in need. He's also really good at
climbing things.

The first Uncharted game sees Drake racing to find El Dorado before an
unscrupulous man and his group of hired mercenaries finds it first. I was mainly
interested in these games because I'd heard the Tomb Raider reboot series played
similarly to Uncharted, but there's *much* more focus on gunfights and action in
this first Uncharted game than I remember in any of the Tomb Raider reboots.
There are a few puzzles and some bits where you need to explore a little, but
mostly you'll be making your way from one area to the next, gunning down dozens
of enemies in your wake.

It was a pretty short game, I finished it on Normal difficulty after just over 6
hours. There were some very challenging sections for me! I'm not the greatest at
shooters, and considered turning the difficulty down when I frequently died at
some spots, but I persevered and was rewarded with a Normal difficulty
achievement upon finishing the game. I think my biggest complaint about
Uncharted 1 is that the platforming/climbing sections were a little rough
sometimes. I missed a handful of jumps and fell to my death, only to make the
exact some jump just fine after respawning. The checkpoint system was pretty
forgiving most of the time, but there was one time were I had to repeat a rather
lengthy platforming section several times because I kept missing a jump near the
end!

I started the sequel, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, pretty soon after finishing
the first game. Immediately, I noticed that this game looks significantly better
than the first. Environments are more detailed, shadows look better, and the
character models also look more detailed here. Not only that, but the climbing
system is tighter, and I didn't have nearly as many accidental deaths while
climbing.

On top of all that, Uncharted 2 also adds in stealth mechanics. You can now
sneak up on enemies and insta-kill them if you're currently undetected. There
are also more puzzle segments compared to the first game. These remind me
heavily of the tombs in the Tomb Raider reboot series, and were a lot of fun.
It's still primarily an action-adventure game, with plenty of thrilling action
sequences, but the stealth mechanics and additional puzzles added some welcome
variety.

Uncharted 2 improved on its predecessor in pretty much every way. There were
more varied environments, the scale of the story was larger, and the cutscenes
were more frequent and had better character animation and expression. I played
the first 2 thirds of the game on Normal difficulty, but around that point I got
tired of dying so much in one of the chapters and switched to Easy for the
remainder of the game. There's definitely a lot of challenge here for those
looking for a more difficult experience, since there are 2 further difficulty
levels above Normal! Between both games I've played so far there is significant
replayability too. Optional treasures are hidden in the chapters, and collecting
many of them unlocks bonuses like the ability to change your character skin. You
can change your skin and make Drake look like his friend Sullivan, or even one
of the villains after you meet the unlock requirements, be it collecting enough
treasures or beating the game on a certain difficulty level.

The Uncharted games have been a lot of fun to play through, even though I've
struggled to know where to go on a few occasions or been obliterated by enemies
on others. I'm definitely glad to have finally given them a try, and I'm looking
forward to playing the last game in the collection, Uncharted 3, and will
probably have to pick up Uncharted 4 at some point in the future too!
