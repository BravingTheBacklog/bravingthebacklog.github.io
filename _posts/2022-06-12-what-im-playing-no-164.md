Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the

### Tales of Arise *(PS5)*    {#TalesofArise}

For 300 years, the people of the planet Dahna have lived in slavery to the
Renans, a race of vastly more technologically advanced people from the nearby
planet Rena. You are just one more Dahnan slave, doomed to live and die in
slavery. Unable to remember your real name, people call you Iron Mask due to the
mask that had been permanently locked onto your head for as long as you can
remember. But in a twist of fate, you encounter a Renan woman named Shionne, and
join up with a small band of Dahnan rebels. Through this chance encounter, you
finally have a glimmer of hope: a chance to live a life free of Renan rule. And,
you finally remember your true name: Alphen.

Tales of Arise is the 17th main entry in the Tales series, and released in 2021
for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. I've played my fair share of
games in the series, but I hadn't played an entry in the series since finishing
Tales of Berseria, the previous game, back in 2018. I was really looking forward
to getting into a Tales game again, so I picked up Tales of Arise on PS5 and it
did not disappoint!

At the core of the game is a fantastic, fast-paced battle system. It feels like
another natural evolution of the action battle system from the previous Tales
game. It forgoes the old Technical Points (TP) system for using skills and
spells and instead each character has an Artes Gauge (AG) they consume for
special attacks that automatically regenerates over time. The battle system also
has always-on free-running instead of having you hold a button to free-run
around the battle arena like in the earlier games. Other new additions include
the ability to jump freely in and outside of combat, making it easier than ever
to start aerial combos, and a dodge button you can use to evade attacks at the
last second and enter a brief slo-mo period where you have the opportunity to
launch a counterattack. Also, healing spells now consume Cure Points (CP), which
are shared by the entire party, and you use Orange gels and other similar items
used to restore them. There are a few more kinds of attacks that help spice up
battles too: Boost Attacks, where you summon one of your party members to
deliver a priority attack, and each party member's attack is especially
effective against specific kinds of enemies, and Boost Strikes, which can be
triggered once you've built up a long enough combo against an enemy at low
health, instantly defeating them. All of this combines to create very enjoyable
battles. Despite the number of mechanics, they never felt overwhelming, and
battles have a great rhythm. It's a blast stringing together long combos against
enemies, and the new dodge roll is a nice addition too!

In addition to a great battle system, Tales of Arise also has a great cast of
characters. I won't spoil any of the story, but they all experience satisfying
character development over the course of the game. Plus, the dynamics between
party members in this game are really interesting. I mentioned Alphen and
Shionne in the intro. They're the first two characters you'll get in your party,
and a prime example of the interesting dynamics because as a Dahnan and Renan
respectively, they *hate* each other. But, Alphen is the only one who can wield
the Blazing Sword, the physical manifestation of the power of Shionne's Fire
Master Core, so like it or not, they're stuck with each other. Seeing how their
views of one another evolve as the story progresses was very satisfying, and the
other characters in your party have similar struggles.

I love this cast of characters, they're probably one of my favorites in the
entire Tales franchise. I think part of that is that I'm familiar with some of
the English voice actors from other video games, so hearing their voices again
was cool. Erica Lindbeck voices Shionne, she's voiced characters in a *bunch* of
games I've played, but her roles as Magilou in Tales of Berseria and Futaba in
Persona 5 come to mind first. Christine Marie Cabanos voices Rinwell, who I knew
as the voice of Hapi in the Cindered Shadows DLC for Fire Emblem: Three Houses,
and Chiaki in Danganronpa 2. Bryce Papenbrook voices Law, but I know him best as
Makoto Naegi from Danganronpa. Lastly, there's Ray Chase, who voices Alphen. The
only video game character I knew he voiced prior to this was the Subway
Announcer in Persona 5, but while researching for this video I learned that he
also voiced Artorius in Tales of Berseria too. The more you know!

In classic JRPG fashion, when you're not in battle, you're exploring towns and
overworld areas. Exploration is simple, but fun. It helps that the visuals here
are gorgeous, with vibrant colors, and a sort of watercolor effect applied to
distant terrain. I mentioned it briefly earlier, but you can now jump freely
while exploring. Sometimes you'll have to make a running jump over a small gap
to reach an optional treasure chest, but otherwise there's not any platforming
to worry about, and the jump is mostly just a fun novelty and a fast way to get
down from high places.

There's another JRPG staple here that I really enjoyed: a fishing mini-game! You
unlock it mid-way through the game, and once I had it unlocked I spent quite a
while fishing. The mechanics of the mini-game are pretty simple, you choose a
spot to fish, press a few buttons to lure the fish in, and once they're hooked
you have to react quickly to keep them on the line and wear down their stamina
meter until its empty. When you've hooked a fish, this battle music starts up,
it's pretty funny. It helps give fishing this over-the-top feeling, and this is
especially true when you run into what the game calls "Boss Fish," which have 2
health bars and can be especially challenging if you're not prepared, demanding
absolute focus to reel them in.

Skits, a staple of the Tales series for many games now, return with some changes
in presentation. In previous games, skits were told using 2D character portraits
and illustrations, but in Tales of Arise, the 3D character models are used
during skits instead. The HD models look great, of course, and they're framed in
manga style panels. The 3D models probably even allow for more range of
expression than the original 2D skits did. All in all, they look good, but it's
definitely a departure from series convention, and some fans might miss the old
form of skits. Personally, I was a little skeptical of them at first, but I grew
to enjoy them just as much as always. If I had one critique of how skits are
used in Tales of Arise, it's that there might be a few too many of them. In some
areas, you would literally watch one skit only for another one to pop up as soon
as the first one was over. Most of them are optional, so you don't have to watch
them when the button prompt pops up, but I felt obligated to view them all
whenever they became available.

Tales of Arise is a *big* game. I went out of my way to complete every side
quest available to me before finishing the main story, and because of that, my
final time when the credits rolled was 63 hours 8 minutes. After finishing the
game, I was still keen to play a bit more, and Tales of Arise has you covered
there too, offering a New Game+ mode as well as a few post-game dungeons and
side quests that unlock after you load your cleared save file. I happily dove
into those, and after finishing them and a few other things to unlock the
platinum trophy, my final time was just over 71 hours. I really enjoyed Tales of
Arise, it's another great entry in the Tales series. If you're a fan of JRPGs
and/or action RPGs, I definitely recommend giving Tales of Arise a shot!
