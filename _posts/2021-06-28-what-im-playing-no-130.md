### Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga *(PS2)*    {#ShinMegamiTensei:DigitalDevilSaga}

I finished Digital Devil Saga this week! It was great, with the remainder of the
experience filled with more challenging battles, challenging bosses, and
interesting dungeons. The story is interesting too, but rather mysterious - and
it's left on a pretty big cliffhanger at the end, to be picked up in the game's
direct sequel, Digital Devil Saga 2.

Like Nocturne, the final dungeon of the game is several hours long, with the
occasional boss fight to mix things up. This dungeon is the huge tower to
Nirvana, which the group finally begins to climb after having defeated the
leaders of the other tribes. There's really only one complaint I have about the
dungeon: some of the random encounters had really *annoying* enemies. One of the
nastier ones were the Samael, which could petrify you and shatter your stone
body with a followup attack, killing a party member instantly. Worse than them
were the Laksmi though. They had an annoying habit of casting Dormina, which has
a chance of putting each party member to sleep, and following it up with Calm
Death, which insta-kills sleeping party members. I wound up running from a
number of random encounters with enemies like that, because it just wasn't worth
it. At times like that, I was also glad to be playing this in an emulator where
I could use save states between battles in case I *did* end up dying to some
random enemies. Eventually, I made it to the top of the tower with my party,
where the final boss was waiting.

The first two forms of the final boss were a cakewalk, even on my first attempt.
But its final form gave me a bit of trouble. I tried to defeat it with the party
build I had for a while, reloading a save state I had made at the beginning of
the fight whenever I died. It soon became clear that I had to make some changes
to my party. I did a bit of grinding, and also checked an online walkthrough at
that point to see if there was some aspect of the boss battle I was missing.
There was definitely something I hadn't thought of: using magic attacks that hit
all enemies. What made the boss battle so difficult the first time around is
that the boss has 6 elemental stones floating around it, and each counts as an
enemy. So in addition to the boss attacking each turn, each stone *also* gets an
attack, and each one uses a different element so they *will* hit someone's
weakness in your party if given the chance. While a stone is active, the boss
will be protected by a barrier that repels attacks of the corresponding element.
On my first try, I was able to take down 1 stone a turn, heal any injuries my
party had suffered, and get 1 attack in on the boss itself. Then on the boss's
turn, it would re-summon the stone I had just defeated, and then unleash 7
attacks in a row. I was *obliterated* by this within a few turns every time. As
the walkthrough suggested though, the key here was to use powerful magic to hit
all enemies at once. By first targeting and eliminating the elemental stone of
fire, I was able to have Serph cast Maragidyne and hit the remaining elemental
stones and the boss for big damage. Thanks to the high magic build I'd given
Serph, this wiped out the remaining stones, and damaged the boss by a decent
chunk too. Follow that up with a debuff on the boss, and then it would usually
spend its turn removing the debuff from itself instead of attacking. With this
strategy, the boss went from impossibly difficult to one of the easier bosses in
the game, and it was defeated very easily.

Afterward, the whole tower begins collapsing under everyone's feet, and they
rush toward the column of light at the tower's center. Everyone is enveloped in
the light, falls through it dramatically, and the credits roll. After the
credits, there are a few scenes. We see Serph in a cloak, walking through a
ruined city, and afterward the text "Are you ready for the real world?"
displays. Now what could that mean...? I think I have a pretty good idea (thanks
to the Wikipedia spoiler I mentioned last week), but I'm still really excited to
see what the 2nd game brings! My final playtime was 23:43. This was a fairly
short RPG, but still quite satisfying!
