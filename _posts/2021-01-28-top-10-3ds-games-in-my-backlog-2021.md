I've heard many times that the 3DS is an amazing handheld due to its awesome
library of games. I got my New 2DS XL in 2018, so this fantastic library is one
I've only scratched the surface of since I haven't been playing 3DS games for
very long. Here are 10 3DS games that I'm looking forward to playing soon(-ish)!

<!--more-->

## 10. {% include game.html game="Stella Glow" %}

Stella Glow is a strategy RPG from the developers of the Luminous Arc series.
Its plot focuses on protagonist Alto's fight against the Witch of Destruction,
who he must combat by recruiting other Witches to his side and using their "Song
Magic."

I don't really know what to expect with this one. With the "Song Magic"
mechanic, there might be a lot of J-pop in it. I enjoyed the songs in Tokyo
Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore, so maybe I'll enjoy the songs in Stella Glow too.
Also, I'm always down to try a new SRPG!

## 9. {% include game.html game="Bravely Second End Layer" %}

Bravely Second: End Layer is the direct sequel to Bravely Default, not to be
confused with Bravely Default II which is a standalone title not related to
Bravely Default or Bravely Second's stories. This series is weird with game
titles.

Bravely Second actually has a lower Metacritic score than Bravely Default (81
compared to 85). With as many issues as I had with the monotonous pacing of a
certain section in the first game, you'd think this would turn me away from the
sequel. I've also read that the characters in Bravely Second aren't as good as
Bravely Default's cast, and can be grating. Even in light of all this, I'm still
curious about Bravely Second because the job and battle mechanics of Bravely
Default were so cool. Hopefully it maintains an enjoyable pace throughout the
entire journey, because that would address my biggest issue with the first game!

## 8. {% include game.html game="LBX Little Battlers Experience" %}

I've read that this game is sort of similar to Custom Robo, and that's all I
needed to hear to get me on board.

LBX is actually a series that spans several games and other media, but most of
it only released in Japan. A few of the anime series were dubbed in English and
aired on Nicktoons in the US, around the same time the 3DS game released in
North America. I'm hoping that you don't really need any knowledge of the anime
to follow the game's story, but I guess I'm not really playing this game for the
story so it won't really matter. If I can customize a little robot with tons of
different parts and battle other robots in fun battles, I'll be a happy camper.

## 7. {% include game.html game="Ever Oasis" %}

Ever Oasis was developed by the same studio who created Ocarina of Time 3D and
Majora's Mask 3D for 3DS, so there's a cool bit of trivia for you.

A spiritual successor to the Mana series in some ways, Ever Oasis is an action
RPG wherein you switch between three party members to battle enemies. It also
has dungeons with puzzles, and even a little bit of a city-building mechanic as
you use the spoils of your adventures to build up a prosperous oasis. I've heard
this is a grossly underappreciated gem on the 3DS, and I'm looking forward to
trying it!

## 6. {% include game.html game="Yokai Watch 2 Psychic Spectres" %}

Just like the earlier LBX entry, this game is part of a series developed by
Level-5 too! Yo-kai Watch was reportedly the "Pokémon Killer" franchise, but
that didn't really pan out. That headline has definitely stuck in my mind since
then though, and left me curious enough about the series that I have to give it
a try myself!

Like Pokémon, Yo-kai Watch 2 features several different versions of the same
game, with a few version-exlusive Yo-kai in each. Psychic Spectres is sort of
like the Pokémon Yellow or Pokémon Platinum of Yo-kai Watch 2. It released after
the initial 2 versions. If you're going to play Yo-kai Watch 2 nowadays, it
sounds like Psychic Spectres is the best way to do so since it has almost all of
the exclusive Yo-kai from the original 2 versions, as well as extra content.

## 5. {% include game.html game="Kid Icarus Uprising" %}

Mixing both aerial and ground gameplay segments, Kid Icarus: Uprising is a
3rd-person shooter in which you control the angel Pit as he does battle against
Medusa's armies at the behest of Palutena, the Goddess of Light. The aerial
shooting segments are on-rails while the ground battles give you more control
over Pit's movement.

Uprising garnered pretty positive reviews from critics, with reviewers enjoying
pretty much every aspect of the game. It's that praise that has piqued my
curiosity with this one. This type of game isn't something I regularly crave,
but I've definitely enjoyed a few on-rails shooters in the past, so I'm looking
forward to seeing what Uprising is like!
 
## 4. {% include game.html game="Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga plus Bowsers Minions" %}

I've played an entry in the Mario & Luigi series before: Mario & Luigi: Partners
in Time on the DS. I've always been really curious about the first game in the
series though, because it's often considered a better game than Partners in
Time.

The Mario & Luigi games are turn-based RPGs with active command elements,
similar to Super Mario RPG or the early Paper Mario games. The battle system in
Partners in Time could be *very* hectic since you had to control both Mario and
Luigi and their baby counterparts (just go with it) at the same time while
dodging attacks. It was definitely a fun system though, so I'm looking forward
to playing more of that, but with only 2 characters to worry about at a time.

## 3. {% include game.html game="Code Name STEAM" %}

Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. is a turn-based strategy game with third-person shooter
elements mixed in, sort of like Valkyria Chronicles. That alone got me
interested in this one, but what sealed the deal is that I was able to get a
brand new physical copy of it for only US$3.59. For that price, I'm definitely
willing to give it a try! That's a lot cheaper than most *digital* games go on
sale for!

Reviews for this one are pretty mediocre, so I'm not expecting anything as
stellar as Valkyria Chronicles, but if the two share somewhat similar gameplay
it should still be a fun time.

## 2. {% include game.html game="Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor Overclocked" %}

Put simply, Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor takes Shin Megami Tensei gameplay
and reshapes it into a strategy RPG. As a fan of SRPGs and a Persona fan only
just getting into SMT, Devil Survivor seems like something I'd really enjoy.

Originally released for the DS in 2009, Overclocked is an enhanced remake for
the 3DS that released only a few years later. I'm looking forward to seeing and
battling more of the fantastic SMT demons, as well as experiencing this new SRPG
version of the combat system. I've heard this 3DS version is considerably easier
than the original DS release, though I don't remember exactly why that is.
Regardless, it definitely seems like the 3DS remake is the one I should try,
both for the difficulty changes and the additional features!

## 1. {% include game.html game="Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse" checkmark="" %}

*Edit*: Finished! This game included everything I enjoyed about the first game
while polishing the experience more and removing the parts I didn't like about
its predecessor. It was awesome! You can [read more of my first impressions on
it in this post]({% post_url 2021-01-18-what-im-playing-no-107
%}#ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse).

As of this writing, I've actually already started playing this game, so it kind
of has to be at the top of the list!

A sequel to Shin Megami Tensei IV that takes place during an alternate timeline
that at first only *slightly* differs from the first game's Neutral Route ending
before continuing the plot in a radically different direction, Shin Megami
Tensei IV Apocalypse builds upon the solid foundation of the first game. It
features even *more* demons than its predecessor, while adding a few new
mechanics and tweaks to this iteration of the Press Turn battle system. There
are also *many* quality of life improvements across the board. The result is
another great game, if my experience with it so far is any indication!
