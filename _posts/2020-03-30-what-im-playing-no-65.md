### Titan Souls *(PC)*    {#TitanSouls}

Another short game I started in my efforts to check more games off my Steam
backlog. In Titan Souls you control a lone adventurer, armed with a bow and a
single magical arrow that you can magically draw back to yourself after firing.
With only these arms at your disposal, you must confront the Titans. These are
the only enemies in the game, and each is like a boss battle where you die in a
single hit. However, this applies to the bosses as well, or at least each of
their phases. Some bosses have multiple phases, so those will take more than one
hit to defeat, but for the most part each battle is a one-on-one fight to the
death, where the key to victory is identifying your opponent's weak spot, and
letting your arrow fly true!

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vAxkT9c.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vAxkT9cm.jpg" alt="Titan Souls"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hAZVhti.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hAZVhtim.jpg" alt="fight to the death"/></a>
</figure>

Unfortunately, shortly after getting past the introductory area I found the
gameplay was just not up my alley. The concept of dying in 1 hit is a cool idea,
it was just too intense for me, since I could only enjoy myself for so long when
I kept dying against the bosses. The visuals are great, and the music sets the
tone well, but the gameplay just wasn't for me. So, I'm retiring this
playthrough, and taking this one off my backlog.

### Richard & Alice *(PC)*    {#RichardAlice}

After Titan Souls fell through, I picked up this point-and-click adventure game
instead. Richard & Alice tells the story of the two eponymous characters in a
ruined world buried by snow. The two meet in prison, as their cells are across
from each other, giving them ample opportunity to talk. The reason for their
imprisonment quickly becomes a conversation topic, and the story unfolds between
the present and the past. In the present, you control Richard in short prison
sections, and in the past you control Alice as she and her 5-year old son Barney
face several hardships common to the brutal world in which they live.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/EFx0MM6.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EFx0MM6m.png" alt="in the past you control Alice"/></a>
</figure>

Like most point-and-click games, at least the ones I've played, the gameplay
consists of examining the world, finding items to add to your inventory, and
combining those items with each other or using them on the environment. For the
most part, the solutions were pretty easy to come by. There was one part later
in the game though that was just *long* and required either extremely thorough
searching, or a guide. I used the latter for that one part, but only after
slowly circling around the area for several minutes and making no progress. It's
a short game, but tells a surprisingly complete and nuanced story. I would
definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a short point-and-click adventure!

### Animal Crossing: New Horizons *(Switch)*    {#AnimalCrossing:NewHorizons}

The Stardew Museum has opened, and it's really cool! I mean, I don't have a ton
of exhibits yet, but the design of the museum in this game is awesome. It feels
really grand this time around, with large exhibit rooms and elaborate displays.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FdoZleJ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FdoZleJm.jpg" alt="elaborate displays"/></a>
</figure>

A full-fledged shop has opened on Stardew too. It starts as Nook's Cranny, and
as someone whose Animal Crossing journey began with the GameCube version, I love
this! I'm sure it will go through the usual tiers of upgrades as time passes and
I buy more things from it. I'm hoping to see Nook N' Go, that was always my
favorite version of the store in the GameCube version! One neat feature I
haven't taken advantage of yet is the shop's drop box. Even after the shop is
closed, you can dump things in the box to be sold, and my understanding is
you'll get paid for them the next day, but there is a handling fee for selling
things this way. It's nice for those who want to do some late night selling
though!

[![another loan to rebuild my entire home and make it larger](https://i.imgur.com/Hiyqmihm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/Hiyqmih.jpg)
{: .image-right }

I also paid off my initial home loan, but as is tradition in Animal Crossing I
immediately took out another loan to rebuild my entire home and make it larger.
Naturally, Tom Nook can have this job completed in a single night. Whatever
construction company he works with is extremely impressive!

More villagers are moving in, before they can move though I needed to built a
bridge with a newly learned DIY recipe from Tom Nook, pick out where their
houses will be built, and supply several furniture items for each house. All the
required furniture items required DIY crafting, many of which I was given new
recipes to craft. It was a tall order, but I finished it all as quickly as I
could the first day, because I was really excited to get more villagers! My
diligence paid off, and Agent S moved in a day later, the same day the bridge
construction was completed! The following day, Gladys joined our happy little
island, followed by Punchy another day later. I'm especially excited to see
Punchy, because I know I had him in a prior game too, possibly my New Leaf
village. With these new villagers, things are really starting to feel less
deserted!

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/w286JaK.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/w286JaKm.jpg" alt="excited to see Punchy"/></a>
</figure>

I unlocked the ability to customize items, which opens up new color options for
most of the DIY items you can create, as well as some of the items you can
purchase from the store. Got my first wardrobe via DIY, which means I can use
the new "change clothes" interface to quickly change outfits using what's in
storage instead of having to change clothes from items in my pockets. I love
this feature, it's definitely led me to change my character's look way more
often. Plus, the way the character poses is just too perfect!

<figure class="third">

</figure>

The final big development on Stardew island was the completion of the new
Resident Services building! At last ditching the tent, we now have a proper town
hall sort of building. Isabelle has also moved in to work at the Resident
Services building, and apparently she lives there or commutes to work because
she doesn't have a house on the island anywhere. Tom Nook also works out of the
building, offering expanded construction options like the ability to construct
inclines and more bridges. I love how much variety the characters have in all
their actions in this game, it brings them to life like never before. For
example, I walked in to Resident Services once and found Tom Nook and Isabelle
doing some stretches behind the counter. Little things like that are so cute!

<figure class="third">

</figure>

I'm looking forward to building up Stardew even more in the coming weeks. At the
end of this week, I had my first opportunity to buy into the Stalk Market, so of
course I stocked up on 1,000 turnips. I'll have to keep a close eye on turnip
prices this week, and hope my investment pays off! I'll end this section this
week with a peek inside my house. The wallpaper is the Server Room Wall, I
believe I got it from Saharah and I just ran with the idea. I need some counters
for the kitchen, and maybe more computer stuff to decorate with, but when it's
completed I hope it will look like my character lives in a server room, always
on-call to make sure everything is running smoothly.

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild *(Switch)*    {#TheLegendofZelda:BreathoftheWild}

I finished my Breath of the Wild playthrough this week! There's a lot to cover, so let's get to it!

My exploration first took me to the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab. The immobile
Guardian alongside the path up to the lab took me by surprise. I pushed my horse
to gallop past it when it began targeting me but we still took a hit, and my
horse caught on fire! Luckily we both made it out alive. The director of the lab
is, uh...quite a character. At his request, I brought the blue flame back to his
furnace to fuel his precious "Cherry," and now I can give it rupees and ancient
parts to craft ancient soldier gear. The armor I can create this way seems
useful since it reduces damage taken from Guardian lasers, but I didn't have
enough ancient gears to create it at first. I came back later and got the
ancient body armor though, and that's what I wore at the end of the game.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

Shortly thereafter, I met Kilton for the first time. I guess he's a Hylian like
Link, but I'm not sure why his skin is gray? Maybe he's a cross between a
bokoblin and a Hylian or something? I don't know, I've just never seen a gray
Hylian before. Anyway, the initial meeting unlocked his travelling shop, Fang &
Bone. Later on, I encountered his shop outside of Kakariko Village, and perused
his wares. You can only pay him in "Mon," which he gives in exchange for monster
parts. I really wanted the Dark Link armor he carries, but it's really
expensive!

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/seF3AtE.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/seF3AtEm.jpg" alt="Dark Link armor"/></a>
</figure>

Afterward, I wandered into a new area. Here, I saw some sort of fire dragon,
like Volvagia, in the distance?! But apparently that has nothing to do with the
Divine Beasts or anything, and I later learned it was one of the guardians of
the land or something when I freed a similar dragon from Ganon's malice atop
Mount Lanayru. Rito Village is in this area too, and was my next discovery. I
really like how the music calls back to the Dragon Roost Island music from Wind
Waker. It's so cool! I always thought the Rito in Wind Waker had evolved from
the Zora over many years, so it's a little strange to see both Zora and Rito in
the same time period in Breath of the Wild, but both species are really cool so
I don't mind.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JE9nWOU.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JE9nWOUm.jpg" alt="I saw some sort of fire dragon"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hmtxwZy.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hmtxwZym.jpg" alt="Rito"/></a>
</figure>

Upon entering Rito Village, a short cutscene introduced me to the final Divine
Beast: Vah Medoh. Fittingly, the Divine Beast once piloted by the Rito Champion
soars through the sky high above Rito Village. I realized at this point that I'd
seen it in the distance many times over the course of my exploration, but I just
thought it was some sort of floating city or something like the one in Twilight
Princess. It was pretty cool to finally learn what it really was, I didn't
expect it to be a Divine Beast.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XCgENz2.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XCgENz2m.jpg" alt="a short cutscene"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vK4X5lI.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vK4X5lIm.jpg" alt="Vah Medoh"/></a>
</figure>

Like with the previous Divine Beasts, I first found the village elder, and got
some information from him on who to talk to about boarding the Divine Beast.
This lead me to Teba, who is basically the modern day Rito Champion but unlike
the other present day Champions I don't think he is actually a descendant of the
Rito Champion from 100 years ago. Maybe he is, but I wasn't given that
impression. Just like with the other Divine Beasts, I first had to complete a
task before we could team up and tackle the Divine Beast. This was by far my
favorite of these tasks, because it was so easy! All I had to do was float
around the Flight Range and shoot 5 targets in mid-air. This serves as a good
tutorial on mid-air bow usage and its time-slowing mechanics, which the player
might not have used much yet. I hadn't really used this ability much, but it was
still a piece of cake. It was refreshing not to have to run halfway across the
region for this task, or escort some useless goron again.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8FKturA.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8FKturAm.jpg" alt="the village elder"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/sZ36ico.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sZ36icom.jpg" alt="Teba"/></a>
</figure>

With Teba impressed by my archery skills, we took to the sky. He gave me more
bomb arrows that I had ever seen before, and told me to shoot down Vah Medoh's
cannons while he distracted its fire. This too was easy for me, and I really
enjoyed floating around Vah Medoh with my paraglider. It definitely was my
favorite of the Divine Beast boarding tasks.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qGPq43Z.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qGPq43Zm.jpg" alt="we took to the sky"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dRL5XfA.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dRL5XfAm.jpg" alt="floating around Vah Medoh with my paraglider"/></a>
</figure>

The cannons were destroyed by my supply of bomb arrows, bringing the Divine
Beast's barrier down and allowing Link to land on it. Teba chickened out, with
the excuse that his leg was injured during the fight by a laser blast. I didn't
really need his help anyway though, so we parted ways. The puzzles aboard Vah
Medoh were fun, and angling Vah Medoh using the map controls, similarly to the
Divine Beasts before it. The size of the Divine Beasts still blows me away a
bit, especially how you can control huge parts of them from the map screen.
Angling Vah Medoh meant tilting the entire dungeon, and that sort of blows my
mind!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MkiiK9f.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MkiiK9fm.jpg" alt="The puzzles"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HTz4Ji8.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HTz4Ji8m.jpg" alt="the map controls"/></a>
</figure>

After the terminals were all reactivated, it was time for the dungeon boss.
Windblight Ganon was remarkably one note. It sort of had two phases, but it
didn't seem to require any special strategy for each phase. I just shot it full
of leftover bomb arrows, which did decent damage. Most of the time it floated
off the ground, but I think twice during the battle my arrows knocked it out of
the sky, and I hacked away at it with the Master Sword. Soon, it was defeated,
and the spirit of Rito Champion Revali was free to control Vah Medoh once more.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KabL3dW.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KabL3dWm.jpg" alt="Windblight Ganon"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PBNct4G.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PBNct4Gm.jpg" alt="Rito Champion Revali"/></a>
</figure>

I want to hate Revali for his condescending nature and arrogance. But I don't
hate him, I just dislike him. The power he gives you, Revali's Gale, is pretty
awesome though. It lets you create a powerful updraft anywhere, which really
helps speed up exploration. Before moving on, I just want to mention how cool it
is that the liberated Vah Medoh perches atop the pillar of stone that Rito
Village is built around.

[![made my way to Hyrule Castle](https://i.imgur.com/9ZR6n1sm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/9ZR6n1s.jpg)
{: .image-right }

With all 4 Divine Beasts liberated, and the Master Sword in hand, there was only
one thing left to do: destroy Ganon. Well, in truth that's not true at all.
There was a *ton* left to do in the game. Plenty of side quests I hadn't
discovered or completed, Shrines, and don't even get me *started* on how many
Korok Seeds I was missing. I never even found where to trade those in, but I'm
pretty sure there's a place you can use them. Anyway, point is, there's plenty
in Breath of the Wild I didn't see, but I was excited to begin the final battle
with Ganon, so after preparing my equipment, I made my way to Hyrule Castle.

There were *so* many Guardians on the path to the Castle, and strewn about the
grounds as well. Luckily I brought along about a dozen Ancient Arrows, but
mostly I tried to avoid the Guardians and their laser blasts. I was pretty
successful overall. My initial plan was to enter the Castle from the west, based
on a tip I'd received from a child at one of the stables. I didn't end up going
with this though, as I was unable to cross the moat from the west and climb up
the cliff side due to the rain. Instead, I approached the Castle via the main
gates. I cannot emphasize enough how impressive the size and atmosphere of
Hyrule Castle is. Seeing a landmark like this completely overtaken by Ganon's
evil power is chilling, and a bit infuriating. It definitely fueled my desire to
strike Calamity Ganon down once and for all! Thanks to Revali's Gale, I feel
like I skipped past most of the winding gatehouse-filled path up to the Castle's
sanctum. I'm not sure what the point of the gatehouses was honestly, but I'm
guessing I would have had a very different experience had I tried to storm the
Castle earlier in my playthrough.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5YMdqOU.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5YMdqOUm.jpg" alt="sanctum"/></a>
</figure>

When I reached the sanctum, Zelda's hold on Calamity Ganon finally gave out, or
may she sensed Link had arrived and let go. Either way, Calamity Ganon emerged
from this weird cocoon thing, and he was not at all what I had imagined. I had
thought I'd be fighting some sort of floating boar-head spirit, like the thing
that was shown flying around Hyrule Castle in several cutscenes. Instead,
Calamity Ganon is this gross amalgamation of Sheikah technology and Malice-ooze.
The design is pretty fitting though, definitely in line with the bosses I'd
fought on the Divine Beasts before. Before the battle began, the Divine Beasts
sprang into action, letting loose their laser blasts and taking Ganon down to
half health before I even touched him. Without their help, this probably would
have been a tough fight, but with Ganon starting at half health he never stood a
chance.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

Destroying Calamity Ganon wasn't the end though. His spirit floated away from
Hyrule Castle, and Link was turned into a ball of light and teleported away too.
On Hyrule Field, the true final battle began. Here, Ganon took his true beast
shape. Princess Zelda spoke to Link telepathically, as she'd done several times
over the course of the game, and gifted him the Bow of Light to truly finish off
Ganon. This was an easy but cool fight. I had my horse, Epona, with me. This
made dodging Ganon's attacks a breeze, and also made it easy to hit his weak
points with the Bow of Light when they appeared as I could leap from my horse
and enter slow-motion aiming easily. After shooting several weak points, I was
able to deliver the final blow and at last end the Calamity.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nJkA7PO.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nJkA7POm.jpg" alt="On Hyrule Field"/></a>

Only when Ganon was defeated did Princess Zelda materialize. Seeing Link and
Zelda together in the present for the first time pretty much gave me chills. I
mean, Link's fighting from the very beginning of the game to help her defeat
Calamity Ganon, and now it's finally said and done, and they're together again,
it was a powerful moment for me. In the final scene, they're looking on at the
ruins of Hyrule Castle, and simple turn and leave without saying anything.
Meanwhile, high above the ruins, the spirits of the 4 Champions and of the King
of Hyrule watch the two leave, likewise silent. This was another *super*
powerful scene, and it said so much despite having no dialogue.

With that, I was done with Breath of the Wild. If you've stuck around since the
beginning of my posts on it, you probably know I went back and forth on whether
I enjoyed this game or not. I definitely struggled with its combat and puzzles
numerous times. I feel like I enjoyed it the most in the final quarter of the
game, basically the section I played through this week. By then, I feel like I
finally had enough heart containers and proper equipment that I wasn't dying all
the time, and I had gotten used to the mechanics of the game enough that I
really enjoyed it. The open world here is definitely superb. As a whole, it's a
master class in non-linear world design. Nintendo and Monolith Soft crafted an
incredible sandbox here, and my hat's off to them for that. Is it my favorite
Zelda game? No, definitely not, but it had some really beautiful moments even
so. Did I love the story? Yeah actually, I did! This version of Hyrule is pretty
different from most other games, and is probably closest to Wind Waker's Hyrule,
so that was interesting to see. Plus, even though I didn't see all of Link's
memories, I loved seeing the Zelda flashbacks. Seeing Zelda struggle in the past
really fleshed out her character in a way that I don't think has ever been done
before in this series. Anyway, I've rambled on enough. I had enough fun in the
endgame that I think I'll probably revisit my save at some point and explore
more of Hyrule, but I think I'm done with Breath of the Wild for a while now.
