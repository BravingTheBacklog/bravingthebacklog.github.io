### Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade *(GBA)*    {#FireEmblem:TheBindingBlade}

My path through The Binding Blade was an interesting one this week. For some
reason, I decided I was going to try playing through this whole game without
using the Restart Chapter option. Usually when I play Fire Emblem, if I lose a
character who I'm even remotely attached to or who is useful in battle, I'll
restart that chapter from the beginning to try and keep them alive. But for this
Binding Blade playthrough, I decided to mix things up, and attempted a No
Restart run. I lost a few units early on, but I also got a few capable new
recruits that made up for the losses. Unfortunately, things began to go downhill
rather quickly.

There was a particularly nasty chapter in which I lost *many* useful units all
at once. That almost prompted me to give up my No Restart run. But I persevered,
despite my army's dwindling numbers. In the chapters afterward, I kept losing
units. A careless mistake here or there, or getting bad RNG and taking a crit,
or a strong enemy barrelling out of the fog of war to kill my healer in 1
hit...I guess I wasn't really playing that carefully a lot of the time, I might
be a little rusty at Fire Emblem. The Binding Blade is also pretty challenging
at times. Anyway, I managed to make it all the way to chapter 22, but by that
point I had only 4 units left capable of fighting. My 4 units against dozens of
enemies...the odds were definitely not in my favor. It was at that point that I
decided my run was no longer viable. I just didn't have enough units to take
down both the legions of enemies and the boss at the end of the chapter.

Luckily, I'd made a few backups saves at earlier chapters, before I lost many
units. I ended up going all the way back to chapter 9, the earliest save I still
had, when *most* of my army was still alive. I went back to playing the way I
usually do, resetting whenever I lost a character that I couldn't stand to lose.
I *still* couldn't make it through some chapters without losing anyone, despite
resetting multiple times to try. In those cases, I pressed onward, simply
because I was tired of retrying the same chapter...but I have kept an earlier
save in case I have to go back to it again. I've also been referring to a guide
for each chapter this time around, to make sure I don't miss out on recruitable
characters. The characters you can recruit sometimes can only be recruited by
having specific characters who aren't Roy talk to them, so I want to make sure I
bring that character along.

The Binding Blade is tough, sometimes downright frustrating and discouraging,
but in the end it's still somehow fun. When you finally figure out a strategy to
get through a chapter with (mostly) everyone alive, it's a good feeling. As for
the translation itself, it's pretty good. There are some typos and the
occasional bit of stiff dialogue, but all-in-all it's a good experience and I'm
grateful I can play through this game in English at all. I'm also glad I'm
playing through it on an emulator for two reasons: 1, I can fast forward through
enemy turns to save time, and 2, I can use save states to help save more time.
Is the second one cheating? Yeah, definitely. I've only recently started using
save states, generally making a new one at the start of each turn, allowing
myself to reset back to an earlier turn if I make a bad call and a character I
need dies. Like I said though, this game is *tough*, and I'm enjoying it more
since I started save stating it up. So I'm going to keep at it, and I'll beat
this game one way or another!

### Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town *(Switch)*    {#StoryofSeasons:FriendsofMineralTown}

When I needed a break from the intense gameplay of Fire Emblem: The Binding
Blade, I turned to a game that is the polar opposite in some ways: the laid
back, relaxing farming sim, Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town. I haven't
played it in a while. Last time I left off I was just at the start of year 2,
and at the time I wasn't ready to start a brand new planting season. This week,
I was ready to kick back, till the fields, and start my cucumber empire.

Not much else happened while I played to be honest. Van was introduced,
reminding me how this series tends to gradual introduce new characters as the
years go by, and I like that about it. My character also continued wooing Karen,
they're dating now. I think I need to save up for a bigger house upgrade before
they can get married though. To end things off, check out all my cows.
