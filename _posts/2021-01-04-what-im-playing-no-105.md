### Shin Megami Tensei IV *(3DS)*    {#ShinMegamiTenseiIV}

After 58 hours of playtime, I finished Shin Megami Tensei IV this week! To my
surprise, I ended up on the Neutral route. I guess my choices throughout the
game up until that point were a pretty even mix of Law and Chaos options.
Anyway, narrative-wise, I really like where the Neutral ending takes the story.
But I have a few issues with some of the gameplay required to get to that point.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

Shortly after a choice that locks you into the Neutral route for the rest of the
game, the pace of the gameplay takes a nosedive. At that point, you need to gain
the respect and admiration of the people of Tokyo, and the way you do this is by
completing 19 specific Challenge Quests. The Challenge Quests are optional up
until this point. More importantly, you only get these quests added to your list
when you either visit the Hunter's Association offering it, or find the NPC
offering it. The trouble with this is that the game doesn't tell you which
quests are the important ones, or give you any aid in locating the NPCs offering
some of the more obscure quests. I gave up and used a guide at this point, and
even then the end result was several hours of *extremely* tedious gameplay. Many
of the quests involved trekking back through earlier areas where I had to wade
through encounters with low level demons. I used the Estoma Sword ability on
some of my demons to skip many of the encounters with low level enemies, but
even then completing these mundane quests was still irritating.

Once you complete all the requisite quests things pick back up quickly, and the
Neutral route has 2 satisfying dungeons to navigate through, with high level
enemies to fight and recruit. I have no idea why the designers thought the
"complete all the quests" section would make for good gameplay. Maybe I missed
some in-game help on this, or maybe I'm in the minority and most people had
completed the quests earlier in the game and just had a few left to wrap up by
that point. I don't think the Law and Chaos routes force you to complete all
those Challenge Quests. At some points, I really wished I had ended up on one of
those different routes instead of the Neutral one, just to avoid the Challenge
Quest slog.

</figure>

Luckily, the game ends on a strong note. In the Neutral route, you reject both
God's Chariot, Merkabah, and the Demon Lord, Lucifer, battling both after
clearing their respective dungeons. Both bosses were pretty easy for my party.
By then, we were pretty high level. They were still really cool and enjoyable
boss fights though. There are also higher difficulty levels available that I'm
sure increase the challenge considerably, but I think those are only available
after you finish the game once.

There are aspects of it I don't understand, but overall I really enjoyed Shin
Megami Tensei IV's story, and its characters, including many of the demons you
encounter. The gameplay was also top notch throughout *most* of the experience,
barring that irritating Neutral route section I mentioned earlier. Now I'm
looking forward to playing the follow-up game on the 3DS, Shin Megami Tensei IV
Apocalypse, someday!

### Bravely Default *(3DS)*    {#BravelyDefault}

After finishing Shin Megami Tensei IV, I continued my 3DS RPG streak by starting
Bravely Default! Developed by Silicon Studio in partnership with Square Enix,
Bravely Default is essentially the successor to classic Final Fantasy. Whereas
the modern Final Fantasy entries have left turn-based battles behind to become
action RPGs, Bravely Default embraces the traditional turn-based formula, as
well as a lot of other classic RPG mechanics. As such, it feels very nostalgic
and comforting, but it has a few new ideas to bring to the table too!

</figure>

Like many RPGs, you travel with a party of 4 characters. These are Tiz, Agn√©s,
Ringabel, and Edea. So many classic RPG elements are here: a world map, random
encounters, and an expansive job system. Elements of each of these remind me of
Final Fantasy I and III, thanks to the job system. Furthermore, the plot and
world are centered around huge crystals that give life to the world, and that's
just straight out of Final Fantasy (not that I have a problem with it!) The way
you acquire new spells is cool too. They're simply bought from a shop, just like
Final Fantasy I. Once you buy a spell, anyone in the party can use it provided
they have enough experience in the requisite job. There are also little optional
dialogue scenes between party members after various events. Bravely Default
calls them Party Talk, but they're the same as skits from the Tales series and I
love it!

</figure>

As far as jobs go, in the beginning only the Freelancer job is available. You
unlock new jobs by acquiring asterisks. These are dropped by bosses, some of
which are bosses in the main story line, others of which are optional bosses of
side stories. I've now unlocked 6 different job types, all of which are pretty
traditional Final Fantasy staples so far, such as White and Black mages, Knight,
and Thief. When you first unlock a job, there's a neat little overview of their
major skills that plays out as an automated battle against a few enemies. I
touched on it earlier, but in addition to gaining experience to level up, each
character also gains job points toward advancing to the next job level of their
current job. Leveling up a job unlocks new abilities or support skills, that
sort of thing. Also, a character will always have access to the skills of their
current job, but you can also use the skills of 1 other job during battle. This
allows you to mix job abilities a bit, by having a White Mage who also can cast
Black Mage spells, for instance. Or a Knight who can use Thief abilities. I
really liked customizing jobs like that in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, so I
have a feeling I'm really going to enjoy the job system!

Where Bravely Default innovates a bit over classic Final Fantasy formula is with
its battle system. In battle, you have all the usual RPG actions, as well as 2
unique to this game: Brave and Default. Default is like guarding, and reduces
the damage you take that turn. However, it also gives you an additional action
(Brave Point, BP) to use on a future turn. Using that additional action is done
by choosing the Brave option. So, if a character Defaults, then on their next
turn they can Brave and perform 2 actions instead of 1, allowing them to launch
multiple attacks, or cast 2 heal spells, and so on. Where this system gets even
*more* interesting is that you can Brave up to 3 times even when you don't have
any actions banked through Defaulting. This puts that character in the negative
BP, and they won't be able to perform any actions for several turns. This opens
up a few strategic options. You can launch an all out assault, making all your
characters take 4 actions their first turn, but this means you'll be helpless
against several turns of enemy counterattacks while your party recovers. It's a
neat system, and I really like it thus far!

Those are the key mechanics of Bravely Default in a nutshell. One other thing I
really like about it is that it features a few familiar voice actors to me.
Voices I recognize from the Persona and Danganronpa series voice several of the
main cast, and I've gotten quite a kick out of that! Also, I want to quickly
mention that this game allows you to really fine tune the experience to your
liking. Any time outside of battle, you can open the game's settings and adjust
the encounter rate for random encounters. I'm usually not the biggest fan of
random encounters. I've been fine with encounter rate in Bravely Default so far,
but it's really nice knowing that I could turn the encounter rate down if I get
annoyed by them later. Anyway, I've liked Bravely Default a lot so far, I'm
looking forward to getting further into it!
