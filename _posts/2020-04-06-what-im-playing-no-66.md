Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Kimmy *(PC)*    {#Kimmy}

While waiting for Persona 5 Royal release day, I picked up this short visual
novel to pass the time. Kimmy is about the eponymous character and her
babysitter Dana, whom the player controls, as Dana becomes Kimmy's babysitter,
helps her make friends, and tries to figure out what's going on with Kimmy and
her family. It also has this simplistic, child-like art style. The simple shapes
that make up characters and their features are almost chalk-like, in a way.

</figure>

The story is set in Massachusetts, near Boston, in the summer of 1968, and there
are a few interesting consequences of settings since the 1960's were a very
different time in America. One thing that sticks out early on is that Kimmy is
regularly tied up on her front porch when her mom has to go to work. Each day
when Dana goes to pick Kimmy up, she's tied up there. Dana is young, so she was
taken aback by this, but her mom doesn't really bat an eye at it and simply says
it's an old-fashioned practice, and that the rope is a "cheap babysitter." A
very different era indeed. Anyway, gameplay consists of buying games from the
store, then talking to the kids around town and teaching them to play games,
which consumes the game item from your inventory. Buying things at the store,
and playing games with kids will cause time to advance 1 hour, and each day you
have 5 hours to kill until it's time to drop Kimmy off at home. When you are
teaching a game, you'll have to answer multiple choice questions about the
game's rules, and I found this to be pretty charming, if simple. It was largely
straightforward what the correct answer was, although I was definitely guessing
in a couple of cases. One game, cootie catcher, I had *never* heard of before.

The game only took about an hour and a half to play through, but I was surprised
at how emotional it got to be in that time. This one definitely hit me hard, so
I'd recommend it for sure if you're looking for a short visual novel, seen
through the eyes of a child in the 1960's.

### Animal Crossing: New Horizons *(Switch)*    {#AnimalCrossing:NewHorizons}

April brought new fish and insects to catch, including several new butterflies,
and I began seeing dragonflies zipping around too. I feel like the dragonflies
are *way* faster in New Horizons than I remember them being in New Leaf. Also, I
love the pun for the darner dragonfly, "It better watch its mouth!" That's too
perfect, haha!

Bunny Day is coming up soon, and Zipper the bunny showed up in town to get
everyone hyped for the upcoming holiday. His arrival meant that colorful eggs
could now be found when harvesting various resources, and when fishing. This
started out cool, and you can learn and craft Bunny Day DIY items that use the
eggs as materials, but I quickly got fed up with catching eggs when I just
wanted to catch some new fish! I caught so many water eggs that I turned into
one.

I paid off my home loan, and again expanded my house. Now, there's a second room
at the back of the house that I've made into my bedroom. My character doesn't
need to sleep in the same room as the server racks now, huzzah!

The tailor shop was built and opened for business this week. I chose a nice spot
by the seaside for it, because it reminds me of my tailor shop's location in
either the original Animal Crossing or in City Folk. Or maybe both...? Either
way, the tailor shop just feels like it should be by the ocean to me. The New
Horizons tailor shop adds a nice new quality of life feature, a fitting room.
Here, you can see all the clothes available to buy at once, build an outfit out
of them, and then buy all the items you're interested in right there. It's a
great feature!

New villager Lopez moved in this week. He first visited the newly built campsite
that I place earlier in the week, and I talked him into moving to Stardew
permanently during his camping trip. It seems like this is the way new villagers
will be introduced from now on, potentially? They'll set up a tent at the
campsite, and you can ask them to move in if you like them.

Once again, I'll be keeping a close eye on the Stalk Market over the next week,
because I've invested all of my savings into turnips. Hopefully I'm able to make
a nice profit...I'll definitely be checking twice a day, every day!

### Persona 5 Royal *(PS4)*    {#Persona5Royal}

Early this week, an updated version of Persona 5 came out: Persona 5 Royal.
PatronusLight and I got the special edition on release day. The new animated OP
is just the beginning of the wonderful additions to the Persona 5 experience.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WiM6YxS.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WiM6YxSm.jpg" alt="Persona 5 Royal"/></a>

</figure>

PatronusLight and I are playing through it together. For the most part, we've
split it up where I play through all the dungeons and combat, and PatronusLight
plays through all the life simulation parts. This leads to hours long stretches
at a time where only one of us will be playing, and the other watching, but I've
really enjoyed it so far! I don't think PatronusLight has enjoyed watching me
play through the dungeons as much as I've enjoyed watching the story and life
sim parts though. Anyway, we named our character Masahiro Worm, and started
playing at the beginning of the weekend and basically only stopped to eat and
sleep.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

This game is so good. It's Persona 5, which was already a fantastic game, but
with even more things to do added into it. PatronusLight is already planning her
New Game+ playthrough on our save file for after we beat it. There are new
elements to combat, like Showtime attacks where two of your teammates partner up
to deliver a flashy and powerful attack. These are really cool! The way they
showcase character interactions is amazing, and they're so over-the-top and
charming they just make me smile every time I trigger one. You can skip over the
animations, but I've watched them most of the time because the characters will
say a few different lines during the attack.

The only weird thing I've encountered is that the "Normal" difficulty felt a lot
easier than Persona 5's Normal difficulty. I actually switched to Hard during
the third dungeon, and found this to be much more in line with how I remembered
Persona 5's difficulty to be. I'm really not sure if it's just because I'm
really accustomed to Persona 5's gameplay by now, having played the original
game 2 or 3 times, or if Royal is just made easier by the gameplay changes.
Either way, Normal mode was fun, but I'm enjoying the balance of Hard more.

Some of the most notable changes made in Royal are the new characters, Kasumi
and Maruki, and overhauling the Justice confidant from the original game. I like
the new characters a lot personally. I feel like they fit in organically most of
the time. At first, Kasumi felt a bit shoehorned in, and have been a few
awkwardly forced conversations, but that might be just because I was so used to
the original game. There's a new music track that plays when meeting with Maruki
that I really like. All the new tracks I've noticed are good, but that one's
probably my favorite because it really amplifies the mood of those scenes.

I'm thinking about doing a full review of the game, or maybe just a post about
how it compares to the original, so I won't go into too much depth or rave too
much about it here. PatronusLight and I took 2 days off work and had a 4 day
weekend, which we spent every possible moment of playing Persona 5 Royal. It was
glorious. Our playtime currently sits at 62 hours, and we're probably only about
halfway through the game! Surprisingly, in that time I haven't taken all that
many screenshots. I've really just been kicking back and relaxing in that
wonderful Persona bliss, and it's been awesome.
