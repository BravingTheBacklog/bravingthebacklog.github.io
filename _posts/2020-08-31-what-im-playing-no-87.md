Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King *(3DS)*    {#DragonQuestVIII:JourneyoftheCursedKing}

I didn't spend as much time playing Dragon Quest this week, but I still made
some progress. This included fighting against a ghost pirate boss, and afterward
I surprisingly got a new party member, Red. Red was involved earlier in the plot
as a side character, but I was surprised to see her come back at this point and
join the party. Apparently this is a new feature in the 3DS version, in the PS2
original she didn't join the party.

I made it far enough in the main story to gain the ability to fly around the
world map! Presumably this opens up more new areas to explore, but I've only
found one so far. I thought that place was where I would have to go next to
advance the main story, and there was a cutscene when I first went there...but
afterward I couldn't find anything there to advance the plot. I have an idea now
of where to try going next, but for a while I was just sort of flying around the
world map randomly and landing in spots I thought were interesting to see if I
would find anything there.

I also did a side quest that I thought was maybe the main plot...but after
finishing it, I'm pretty sure it wasn't. It was still fun though, it involved a
dungeon with lots of dragon skeletons.

### Zero Escape: The Nonary Games *(PC)*    {#ZeroEscape:TheNonaryGames}

This is the main reason I didn't play much Dragon Quest over the past week. I
was hooked on this visual novel/puzzle game! Part of the Zero Escape series,
"The Nonary Games" is a collection of 2 games in the series. The first is the
one I played through this week, Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. Originally
a Nintendo DS game, it's been remastered for modern platforms in this
collection, and that's the version I played through this week.

As primarily a visual novel, this game is mostly dialogue, with branching paths
and multiple endings depending on your choices. The premise is super
interesting. College student Junpei wakes up locked in a room on an old cruise
ship, with a strange bracelet locked on his wrist. Shortly after he wakes, the
glass on the window breaks, and water begins pouring into the room. With the
water level rising fast, the player must control Junpei and solve the puzzle in
this escape room scenario. Junpei's life depends on it! You're actually not
timed at any point in the game though, so despite the rushing water you can take
as long as you need to solve the puzzle. I was stumped on this one for a bit,
until I searched the room more and realized I hadn't found all the necessary
clues to escape. Once I found all the clues needed, I was able to escape without
any issue, and that helped me realize that the solutions to the puzzles were
never anything too obtuse. If something didn't make sense, chances are I just
hadn't found all the clues yet.

</figure>

After escaping, Junpei soon runs into others on the ship in his same
predicament. They all have numbered bracelets on their wrists as well. Like
Junpei, they remember being gassed by some kind of smoke grenade, and seeing a
strange figure in a gas mask before they lost consciousness and woke up on the
ship. That figure soon speaks to them over the ship's intercom, announcing
themselves as "Zero," the captain of this ship, and explaining that they are now
part of a life and death game - the Nonary Game. The group has 9 hours before
the ship sinks. They must make their way through a series of numbered doors. The
9 door is the exit - that's their goal.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

Furthermore, opening a numbered door has several rules. Only 3-5 people may go
through a numbered door, and they must scan their bracelets at an authentication
device by the door called a RED. Once they've scanned in, they pull the lever on
the device, and if the digital root of the entered numbers matches the number on
the door, it will open. Then they have 9 seconds before the door closes, and
only those who authenticated can pass through the door. Once inside the door,
the detonator in their bracelets activates, and they have only 81 seconds to
find another scanning device, this one called the DEAD, and authenticate their
bracelets there to deactivate the detonator in their bracelets. Everyone who
passed through the door must authenticate at the DEAD to deactivate the
detonator, otherwise it will go off - and cause the bomb within their digestive
system to explode.

</figure>

You might be asking, "what's this digital root thing?" Don't worry, the game
goes into a lot of detail about this, and even gives you an in-game calculator
with a "Digital Root" function if you want or need to calculate a bunch of
digital roots quickly. To calculate a digital root, you add each digit of a
multi-digit number together. If the result is more than one digit, you repeat
this until you are left with a single digit result. This is the digital root. So
something like 234 would be 2 + 3 + 4 = 9, for a digital root of 9. Or 5678, 5 +
6 + 7 + 8 = 26 = 2 + 6 = 8.

With those rules in mind, the group gradually moves through the numbered doors
they encounter. At several junctions, you'll have to choose which door you want
to pass through, with branches in the story occurring at several points. While
the story branches rejoin early on, towards the end there are several different
branches depending on your choices, and each of these lead towards one of the
several endings. Past each of the numbered doors, there are usually 1 or more
escape room situations, and this is where the puzzle gameplay comes in. Like
with the initial "escape the flooding cabin room" situation, you'll have to
examine your surroundings to find clues and items, sometimes combining items or
solving puzzles to advance. Some of the later puzzles were pretty difficult, at
least for me. One has you solving a magic square, and I spent a bit of time
trial-and-erroring my way through that one.

A note on the graphics, the entire game plays out over pre-rendered backgrounds,
which I always enjoy. Pre-rendered backgrounds have this nostalgic feel, and I
love it. The character sprites look pretty nice too, and each of them has at
least one surprisingly fluid animation. Aside from the animations, all character
sprites have several different poses, which combined with the voice acting keeps
things interesting.

I won't spoil any of plot, or any of the endings, but I just want to say...*wow*.
This plot is pretty incredible. Each ending I saw left me curious what the other
endings might be, and eventually I found my way to the true ending and
everything comes together *really* nicely. Just an awesome story all around.
It's full of mystery, sci-fi goodness, and just the right amount of suspense and
eeriness. I'm really looking forward to playing the next game in the Nonary
Games collection, Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward next! For now, I'll leave
you with the music that plays when you get one of the several Bad Endings in
this game. I was really impressed with this track. The way it complements
whatever bad ending you just saw is perfect...but I admit that it probably won't
have the same effect listening out of context!
