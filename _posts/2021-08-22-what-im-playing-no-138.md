### The Messenger *(PC)*    {#TheMessenger}

This is a retro, 8-bit/16-bit styled 2D action platformer, and a really good one
at that! Really difficult at times, yes, but extremely fun nevertheless. You
play as a ninja whose village is the last vestige of humanity after a war with
demons centuries ago. They remain vigilant, as legend says that the demons will
strike again and try to eradicate them someday. They also have legends that
speak of the Messenger, one who will be tasked by the Western Hero to carry a
scroll paramount to the clan's survival across the land. Just minutes after the
game begins, all these things come to pass - the demons attack, razing your
village, and the Western Hero arrives, kills the demon king, and tasks you with
delivering a scroll, making you the titular Messenger.

As an 8-bit styled 2D action platformer, gameplay consists of you running to the
right, navigating obstacles, and fighting enemies and bosses. The platforming in
this game is really unique. You don't have a typical double jump, but instead
you can only jump in mid-air after hitting something with your sword while
airborne. This is called the cloudstep technique, and it's pretty awesome!
There's no limit to how many times you can cloudstep either, so you can remain
in the air forever as long as you have enemies or other objects to attack in to
replenish your cloudstep. You can also buy upgrades that give you helpful
abilities as you go, and there are also mandatory upgrades you'll be given as
you progress, like the ability to climb walls and the rope dart (which is
basically a horizontal grappling hook). It all comes together to create
platforming that flows really, *really* well.

</figure>

The game progresses like that for a few hours, depending on how fast you go
through the levels, and then it takes an interesting turn: it becomes a
metroidvania, and goes 16-bit! At that point, you unlock the world map and area
map, allowing you to see where you've been, and a few warp points to quickly
revisit areas you went through in the past. The first time through, you went
through all these places from left to right, but now you'll be going right to
left quite often, and it makes for an interesting switch.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

The first part of The Messenger is great, but the 2nd part, after it goes full
non-linear metroidvania mode, is probably even better. One of the interesting
things is that you get access to portals that swap the world from 8-bit to
16-bit, and parts of the levels change depending on which style you're in. Maybe
there are spikes on the floor in 8-bit that won't be there in 16-bit, or a wall
that goes away. This adds a nice layer to the experience, and sometimes gives it
a nice, light puzzle solving feeling.

</figure>

Now, maybe you don't normally like metroidvanias because you hate backtracking
and feeling lost. Well, The Messenger offers a nice solution to that problem.
You're given pretty cryptic hints about where to go next by one character, but
if you want a more concrete answer, you can pay the shopkeeper a small fee to
figure out what the other guy actually means, and he'll mark the spot on your
map you need to go next. It's that simple. For the most part, I explored the
world on my own and found most of the things I needed to, but there were
definitely a few times I was glad to have the shopkeeper's help!

</figure>

The last thing I want to mention about this game is that it's pretty funny. It's
very light-hearted and jokey throughout, and the characters make references to
it being a video game a number of times. On top of that, you run into some
genuinely amusing twists too, like how after you defeat a certain boss, it turns
out he wasn't really evil and it was all a big misunderstanding. Then you
apologize, he accepts your apology, and you part on good terms. It's a funny
exchange that I can't really do justice just explaining. To summarize, I
definitely recommend The Messenger to anyone interested in innovative,
challenging platformers or metroidvanias. Plus, it has a really good soundtrack!
My final playtime was 7:42.

### Catmaze *(PC)*    {#Catmaze}

Catmaze is another metroidvania I started this week, but unlike The Messenger, I
didn't finish it, and I don't think I will. I don't think it's a *bad* game,
it's just an okay game. It's set in a fantasy world inspired by Slavic folklore,
where you play as Alesta, a young sorceress trying to help her sick mother.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VnXTE8O.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VnXTE8Om.jpg" alt="Catmaze"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tFZDEm0.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tFZDEm0m.jpg" alt="Alesta"/></a>
</figure>

Looking at the screenshots I took, they actually look pretty good. The sprite
art is vibrant and colorful, and it looks nice. But the game doesn't look as
good in motion, and I can't exactly pin down why. I don't know if it's that the
animations are rough or have too few frames, or maybe it's the animated grass
tiles. It's hard to explain.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DuKJvCo.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DuKJvCom.jpg" alt="the screenshots"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xFMKNWo.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xFMKNWom.jpg" alt="look as good"/></a>
</figure>

I think the gameplay in Catmaze fares a little better than the visuals though.
It's pretty basic metroidvania stuff: explore, fight enemies, get new abilities
and weapons. There are enough branching paths to explore on the map to make it
interesting. Enemy behaviors are pretty simple, they start attacking you once
they're close enough. I think it'd be better with more interesting abilities. I
played for about 2 hours, and in that time the only interesting power I got was
the double jump, and that was right near the end of my 2 hours playing it.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

I don't want to be too hard on this game though, because with the exception of
the music, it was made by one person. It might be a bit rough around the edges,
but just the fact it was brought to market by a solo developer is pretty
impressive. I have to give them credit for adding things like Steam achievements
and trading cards too, those are nice touches to have.

Another thing I will give Catmaze credit for, it pulls from some novel source
material. Slavic folklore isn't something a lot of games tap into, so it feels
pretty fresh in that regard when characters talk about creatures like Domovoy or
Kikimora. As you might have wondered from the title, the game is also obsessed
with cats. Several characters mention how great cats are, and how they're from
another world or something.

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/aP3JN3D.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aP3JN3Dm.jpg" alt="Several characters"/></a>
</figure>

I'd have a hard time recommending Catmaze to anyone. If you're a fan of
metroidvanias and have played a lot already, it probably pales in comparison to
your favorites, and if you're looking to get into the metroidvania genre there
are way more polished games you could start with.

### Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia *(DS)*    {#Castlevania:OrderofEcclesia}

I started one last metroidvania late in the week, Castlevania: Order of
Ecclesia. You play as Shanoa, a warrior of Ecclesia, an organization formed to
fight against Dracula. She loses her emotions and memories when another member,
Albus, betrays the order during an important ritual, and steals Dominus, a
powerful magic that Shanoa was meant to be a vessel for.

[![drop glyphs](https://i.imgur.com/Kbfyh9Dm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/Kbfyh9D.png)

A lot of mechanics from prior Castlevania games return here, but it also does a
few things differently. Enemies sometimes drop glyphs after you defeat them,
which Shanoa can absorb to gain new attacks and skills. This is basically a new
iteration of the souls system from the 2 Soma Castlevania games.

Where this game differs from its predecessors is that, so far, it's been a lot
more linear, because it has a world map and the game is split into different
areas. Each of these has some metroidvania elements, like branching paths to
explore and sometimes new abilities, but on a very small scale.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Avi6ite.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Avi6item.png" alt="a world map"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5YB5Ogn.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5YB5Ognm.png" alt="new abilities"/></a>
</figure>

We'll see if the game becomes more non-linear later on, but even if it doesn't
it's a lot of fun. Combat is really satisfying, the different weapon type glyphs
you collect all handle a little differently, with varying levels of delay
between attacks, and some projectile attacks. It's the same level of flexibility
offered by past Castlevania games, and it's just as great as always. The bosses
have been cool so far too, it's always fun facing off against these huge
monsters. The music is really good too, as expected of a Castlevania game. I'm
looking forward to playing through the rest of the game in the next week!
