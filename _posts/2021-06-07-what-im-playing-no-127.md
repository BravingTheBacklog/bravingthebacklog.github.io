- Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster

Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

I only played 1 game again this this week, Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD
Remaster. My coverage on it is spoiler-free!

### Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster *(PS4)*    {#ShinMegamiTenseiIII:NocturneHDRemaster}

I made it past the boss I had been struggling with at the end of last week,
Raidou Kuzunoha. After a little grinding in the Labyrinth of Amala, a dungeon
that I think is optional, I was a bit stronger and more importantly had the
strong debuff skill War Cry on Demi-fiend. War Cry severely lowers all enemies'
attack, so after hitting Raidou with one of those in 2nd phase of the fight, the
attacks he used that were demolishing my party before now did *much* more
manageable damage. Raidou remains silent after the fight, with his cat companion
Gouto doing the talking instead. These characters are actually from another Shin
Megami Tensei spin-off, which is neat. Anyway, I know there's at least one more
(optional?) fight against Raidou in the game, but I haven't come across it yet.
He might crush me again next time I see him!

The main story has begun to take more solid shape. The central conflict is that
the Vortex World exists solely to be reshaped into a brand new world by a human
with enough power and determination. Having been made part-demon, it doesn't
seem like the player character is a contender for the one who will create the
new world, but there are several humans around who could. There's Hikawa, the
man who orchestrated the Conception and destroyed the old world in the first
place, who wants to create a serene world without emotion. He's played off as
the main antagonist through much of what I've played so far, but I think you can
actually side with him for one of the game's routes. There's also Chiaki, who
wants to create a world ruled by the strong, with all unnecessary dead weight
removed. There's Isamu, who wants to create a world (or maybe "worlds?") where
everyone lives in isolation and doesn't have to care about anyone else. There's
also Yuko who...well, I'm not entirely sure what she wants the new world to be
yet! I think the most interesting thing about all these routes is that there's
not a right or wrong answer. The old world is dead, and it seems returning to
the life everyone knew before isn't possible, so the only way forward is
creating a new world. I think I'm leaning towards siding with Chiaki, just to
see how that turns out. Although Isamu's world sounds interesting too, and he's
voiced by Robbie Daymond, so that's a plus.

Much of my time spent playing has been exploring dungeons, and recruiting and
fusing new demons. One of the best demons I've fused has been Hell Biker. A
little earlier in the game, he was a boss battle, and I think I was only able to
fuse him because I had defeated him in battle prior. Hell Biker is immune to a
bunch of different elements, has no weaknesses, and even learned a passive skill
that makes his regular attack target all enemies, so he's been a valuable
addition to my party since I got him! Daisoujou was the same way, they were a
boss battle first, but I was able to fuse them in the Cathedral of Shadows a
short while after. Daisoujou is really cool because they know the Prayer skill,
which fully heals the whole party. It costs a lot of MP, but they also have
Meditation, a skill that allows them to drain HP and MP from an enemy, so they
pretty much can't run out of MP unless you let them get too low to cast
Meditation.

Earlier in the game, I would often run out of money and not have enough to
properly negotiate with demons. That hasn't been an issue in a while though - I
have plenty of money now! I think the reason for that is twofold: enemies drop
more money at this point in the game (at least on Normal difficulty), and
there's been no shortage of random encounters in the dungeons I've been going
through. Sometimes the encounter rate feels *a bit* high, but most of the time I
don't mind because combat has such a great flow to it. Once you learn the
resistances and weaknesses of the enemies in a dungeon, you can defeat them
really efficiently. It's pretty fun figuring out how to use my party to defeat
the enemies quickly and without using too much MP so I don't run out when going
through a long dungeon!

That pretty much wraps up my time with Nocturne so far. Whether I'm close to the
end or only halfway through, I'm not really sure! The average for the main story
on HowLongToBeat.com is 53 hours, and I'm only around 26 hours in. I don't
really mind if I still have a lot of the game left though, the dungeons and
battles have been a lot of fun. The atmosphere in this game is something else
too; surreal, and eerily beautiful. I'm definitely down for more!
