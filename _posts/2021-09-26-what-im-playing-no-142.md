### Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux *(3DS)*    {#ShinMegamiTensei:StrangeJourneyRedux}

I finished Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux this week! The road to the
end was every bit as epic as I've come to expect from the SMT series. Since I
was on the Law route, my path was blocked by Chaos demons as bosses and
mini-bosses.

Most of my time this week was spent going through the final dungeon. It was a
long one! On top of the elements used in previous dungeons, it also had rooms
where the paths were invisible on the automap until you walked on them. I
treated these mostly the same as the Dark Areas: just bump into walls until you
find the right path! There was one part where I just could *not* figure out how
to advance, and I had to look up a walkthrough. Turns out I had missed an
invisible door, and I just needed to find and go through it. After that, I hit
my stride dungeon crawling again. This was a *good* final dungeon, long enough
to feel like a real challenge but not too long that it becomes fatiguing.

</figure>

Before I reached the final boss, I had heard they were difficult. What I'd heard
was accurate; this was one tough fight! When I first reached them, I was level
72, with the rest of my party as low as level 63. I gave it my all, using
healing items like no tomorrow to heal party members, and I actually brought the
boss's health bar a lot lower than I expected on my first attempt before it
wiped us out. *All* of Mem Aleph's attacks hit hard, and most of them hit the
entire party too. It also has insta-kill attacks, as well as the ability to
inflict rage on the whole party, so protecting against both turned out to be
very important. After that first attempt, I failed several more times. I did a
*little* grinding, and came back 1 level higher. That time, my 9th attempt, I
defeated Mem Aleph! After 8 tries, I was ecstatic to have defeated it! And then
I found out it had a 2nd phase immediately after the 1st one I'd struggled so
much to beat. The 2nd phase wiped out my entire party on the first turn, and I
aggressively shut off my 3DS for the night.

<figure class="third center">

</figure>

The next day, I scoured the Internet for tips on how to approach this fight.
Then I scoured the Internet for tips on how to grind quickly in this game, and
found a tip on GameFAQs suggesting a specific area to defeat enemies easily, and
to remove 2 members from your party since fewer party members means more
experience for the remaining members. Using this strategy, I reached level 84 in
about an hour, maybe an hour and half. As I gained levels throughout the
grinding session, I periodically fused stronger demons, and eventually fused
Metatron, a series demon who is usually pretty strong, and this game is no
exception.

<figure class="third center">

</figure>

With my new team, I took on the final boss again. This was my 11th attempt. It
was *much* easier after all that grinding, and with the knowledge gained from my
other 10 tries. The first phase went down without any major hiccups, and we
moved on to phase 2 again. Unlike the 1st phase which has no weaknesses, phase 2
has a weakness that changes every few turns, as well an element that it will
repel that changes at the same time. Other than that, it's very similar to the
1st fight. The 1st turn here was rough, with some of my demons getting knocked out,
but I was able recover. Afterward, the rest of the fight went smoothly, and I
finally defeated Mem Aleph for good!

</figure>

I could feel the tension melt away after I walked out of that battle. It was a
little weird that I had to walk out of the dungeon afterward, I had expected it
to just go to a cutscene. Well, turns out Strange Journey Redux has *another*
boss battle after Mem Aleph part 2, but I didn't know that so I didn't save
between the two!

That new character, Alex, who I'd only seen twice throughout the whole game
since I ignored the optional dungeon, showed up one last time to settle things.
I went into the boss battle pretty nervous, and *really* not wanting to lose and
have to fight Mem Aleph again. Luckily, Alex was a complete Joke to my party. We
mowed her down, and with that I beat Strange Journey Redux, for real this time.

In the Law ending, absolute peace is brought to the world, with everyone
becoming "one immense, harmonious spirit." It's an interesting ending: world
peace was achieved, forever, but the cost was humanity losing all individuality.
I alluded to this a little in my last post, but when you choose to go the Law
route, you see a little preview of humanity's future. The rest of your crew
basically become brainwashed, with their eyes glazing over and their emotions
becoming muted. It was honestly really sad to see, because they just don't seem
like themselves after that.

<figure class="third center">

</figure>

So yeah, that's the gist of the Law ending. Really great game, if you're looking
for a RPG with a focus on dungeon crawling and some challenging moments,
definitely think about giving Strange Journey Redux a try! My final time was
47:44.

### Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate HD *(PC)*    {#Castlevania:LordsofShadowMirrorofFateHD}

In honor of Metroid Dread's upcoming release, I decided to play another game
MercurySteam developed: Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate HD. Wow,
that's a long title! So Castlevania: Lords of Shadow was a reboot of the series
produced by Kojima while he was still with Konami. Mirror of Fate is a sequel to
that game, originally released for the 3DS in 2013, and this HD version launched
later for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

You play as several characters, with a different one for each act of the game.
In the first act, you control Simon Belmont, whose name you might recognize
since he's the protagonist of the first Castlevania game, and he's in Super
Smash Bros. Ultimate. They went a different direction with his look in this
game, giving him bright red hair. They probably took inspiration from Simon's
appearance in Castlevania: Chronicles.

Anyway, you're Simon Belmont, and your goal, as always, is to kill Dracula.
Lords of Shadow was *very* different from other Castlevania games. It's a 3D
action adventure game. Mirror of Fate is a lot more like the other Castlevania
games, but there are a few areas where it differs. Right off the bat, the tone
is much darker. It's got that "gritty medieval fantasy" aesthetic going on. At
first I didn't really like this, but I'm used to it now.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/aOrFvYr.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOrFvYrm.jpg" alt="Simon Belmont"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FrSKocx.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FrSKocxm.jpg" alt="Mirror of Fate"/></a>
</figure>

The other major difference is with combat. Mirror of Fate feels a lot more like
a hack and slash game than the other 2D Castlevania games. You have several
combos at your disposal, and as you level up you'll learn more. You can also
block enemy attacks, except for unblockable ones that cause the enemy to glow
before they launch the attack. Well-timed blocks cause the enemy to stagger,
opening them up for a massive counterattack. It took me a *long* time to get
used to this combat. I think my problem is that I kept trying to play it like a
Castlevania game, and that doesn't work because the flow is very different. I
was trying to keep my distance from enemies, but here you don't really need to,
and it's usually better to stay close and use your dodge roll and block as
needed to avoid damage. Enemies that could block my attacks were *especially*
annoying, as I didn't really know how to deal with them. When I realized I'd
learned a special attack from leveling up that let me break an enemy's guard,
things got a lot easier!

[![the climbing system](https://i.imgur.com/NagHSchm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/NagHSch.jpg)

Another thing that stood out to me here is the climbing system. Similar to
something like Assassin's Creed or Uncharted, you can climb many obstacles, and
you're given glowing visual cues for handholds you can use. It's not perfect,
and I fell to my death several times when I assumed there was a handhold
somewhere and there *really* wasn't. But it works well most of the time, and
adds a nice element to exploration.

Exploration itself is pretty guided, there's an objective marker on your map
telling you where you need to go, though I think you can turn it off if you
want. The map is split into small sub-areas, and it's largely linear, though
there are a few areas with multiple exits leading to other levels. There are
many optional things to find as a reward for carefully exploring each area, so
that's nice. Max health upgrades, max magic upgrades, things like that, as well
as scrolls sitting by dead knights that don't do much other than explain how
they died and contribute to your completion percentage. You get utility upgrades
as you progress that allow you to double jump, or swing from grapple points. In
that regard, it does *sort of* feel like a metroidvania, but there's really very
little backtracking required.

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/svJ2N6H.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/svJ2N6Hm.jpg" alt="little backtracking"/></a>
</figure>

There's also several *puzzles* in this game, and that surprised me a bit. In
most metroidvanias, there aren't puzzles, because the non-linear exploration of
the map basically *is* a puzzle. The ones in this game were fun to figure out
though, so I'm not complaining.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

One thing I really miss from the other Castlevania games: RPG elements! You
level up in this game, but that's about it, and it doesn't seem to do much
besides unlock new combat skills. Previous Castlevania games had equipment and
items, stats, and all kinds of other RPG elements sprinkled in, and I miss those
in Mirror of Fate. But if you look at Mirror of Fate HD on its own, and don't
compare it to the Castlevania series, it's a solid 2D action adventure game. I'm
in the middle of the final act now, currently at 6:30. HowLongToBeat.com lists
the Main Story as 8:30 long, so I'm pretty close to the end. If you're a fan of
action adventure games, considering giving this one a try. It's pretty simple,
but it's executed well, and it's a fun time.
