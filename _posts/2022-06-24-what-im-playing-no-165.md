Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

There's no spoilers in this post. Katamari doesn't really have spoilers,
although there are some screenshots of levels and discussion of level gimmicks
below, so if you want to avoid those you should probably stop reading.

### We Love Katamari *(PS2)*    {#WeLoveKatamari}

Did you play Katamari Damacy? It's such a fun and bizarre game, right? If only
it had a sequel to give us more of the sheer joy of Katamari. Oh wait, it does!

We Love Katamari is the second game in the Katamari series, following Katamari
Damacy. It released in 2005 for PlayStation 2, and that's the only release it's
ever had. It's never come to PC, or any other platforms. So for many people, the
most accesible way to play it these days is probably emulating it using a PS2
emulator like PCSX2. That's what I did!

If you liked Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari is very similar, but it does
tread some new ground. There's more variety here compared to Katamari Damacy,
likely thanks to its larger budget. The level designs are more varied, with
levels taking place at different times of day, and in more locales, including an
underwater level. Some levels feature interesting gimmicks. There's a level
where you have to roll around a sumo wrestler as your Katamari, and he starts
out as an oblong shape and gets rounder the more stuff you roll up, which has an
interesting effect on the rolling physics. There's also a level where the
Katamari is on fire, and you have to keep it lit and get it big enough to light
a large bonfire. Another level puts the Prince in a tiny car, and forces you to
constantly accelerate very quickly. That one was really fun, racing around at
high speed while rolling things up was a really cool change of pace! You never
know what the next level in this game will be like, and that helps keep things
interesting.

Overall, I think the soundtrack of We Love Katamari isn't quite as strong as
Katamari Damacy. It maintains the ecclectic nature of its predecessor, but the
songs just weren't as memorable to me. That said, there are still some real
standouts in this OST, Katamari on the Swing and Everlasting Love were my
personal favorites. Plus, you have the option to pick what background music you
want to play during each level, which is a nice new level of customization. I
picked Everlasting Love more than a few times!

Running it on PC using PCSX2, the visuals look great. I played it in widescreen
at 1080p and the levels looked just as good as the official Katamari Damacy
Reroll release of the first game. Playing on emulator does have some minor
drawbacks though. There are sometimes minor visual glitches, like on the results
screen. These might be solveable by tweaking some settings in PCSX2, but they're
so minor that I didn't feel it was worth trying. I switched from the last stable
release, PCSX2 1.6, to the 1.7 development release of PCSX2 mid-way through my
playthrough, and 1.7 has way fewer visual glitches out of the box than the
stable release does.

Due to the interesting variety in level design and gimmicks, We Love Katamari
has a stronger middle section than Katamari Damacy, but its final level is
significantly weaker and didn't make nearly as strong an impression. However,
one of the later levels in We Love Katamari has you make a *massive* Katamari
very similarly to the final level of Katamari Damacy. I feel like that *should*
have been the final level in We Love Katamari, and it would have been a much
more fun way to end it. That said, both games are really good. The same
eccentric sense of humor pervades them both, and the Katamari rolling gameplay
is still wonderfully unique and addicting. If you're looking to get into the
Katamari series, I'd probably recommend you start with Katamari Damacy,
especially since its HD version, Reroll, is available on modern platforms. But
if you've played Katamari Damacy and you're looking for more, We Love Katamari
is exactly that, and I definitely recommend giving it a try if you're in that
camp! I'm not sure exactly how long it took me to finish the game since there's
no time tracking information in either We Love Katamari or PCSX2, but
HowLongToBeat.com lists the main story as 8 hours long, and my final time was
probably somewhere around that.
