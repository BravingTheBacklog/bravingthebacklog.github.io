Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the

### Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore *(Switch)*    {#TokyoMirageSessionsFEEncore}

I played a ton this week, and finished the game!

The rest of the EX Story chapters became available while I played, which meant I
got more costumes for my party as I explored and found the treasures chests in
the EX Story dungeon. Some of the highlights among these were a Nurse costume
for Kiria, an Etrian Odyssey Nexus costume for Ellie, and a costume I had *no
idea* was in the game, a Fire Emblem: Three Houses costume for Mamori that makes
her resemble Annette. This was such a surprise to find! I was expecting only
costumes from Atlus games but it makes a lot of sense there would be Nintendo
ones as well!

As always, a lot of my time in Tokyo Mirage Sessions this week was spent doing
character side quests. Also as always, these were quite entertaining! I don't
have much to say about them in particular, so I'll just leave a few screenshots
below.

On the main story front, the group finally learned who the evil mastermind
behind the Mirage attacks was: a Mirage called Gharnef who wants to perform a
ritual called the Opera of Shadows in order to resurrect the Shadow Dragon and
destroy the world. The final dungeon of the game appears, but before Itsuki and
company can head in they have to break the barrier blocking their path.

Breaking this barrier is the main goal of chapter 5, which begins with the
player getting the ability to break walls that they couldn't before. This opens
up new areas in basically every dungeon in the game up to that point, and you
have to go back to each one and complete some objective in the newly opened
areas. This kind of thing can be tedious if done poorly, but I'm pleased to
report it was handled *very well* here, and I actually enjoyed returning to the
old dungeons to explore new areas! The areas were filled with stronger new
monsters which dropped new materials, which in turn meant new weapons and skills
could be crafted, and it continued to feed into the very compelling gameplay
loop.

I was surprised in the final chapter when we broke the barrier to the final
dungeon, but weren't immediately able to enter it. The group first had to
explore a smaller dungeon to gain the powers of ancient Fire Emblem heroes of
the past. This would allow them to perform the Opera of Light to summon the
Divine Dragon, who they needed to fight back against the Shadow Dragon. This
dungeon mainly consisted of boss battles against the spirits of the ancient
heroes, who resembled the Mirages of the party.

At the end of this short dungeon, Gharnef was waiting. There's a boss battle
against him, and it was a pretty easy one. I think the fact I was playing on
Normal difficulty, and that I'd done a lot of side quests and a bit of grinding
beforehand, meant my team was well prepared for this fight. The group defeats
Gharnef, and can finally enter the final dungeon of the game where the Shadow
Dragon, Medeus, waits.

The final dungeon took me *much* longer than I expected. It was a little long,
but it really didn't help that I got stuck on a puzzle in one of the sections
for probably over an hour. Anyway, the structure of the dungeon was pretty cool.
In between each exploration and puzzle solving segment, you have to fight a boss
from earlier in the game. Having been newly resurrected by the Shadow Dragon,
they all had major bones to pick with Itsuki and company!

After all of those bosses were dealt with, it was on to the main event: Medeus.
As expected with an RPG, a lot of plot stuff happens prior to the final battle
beginning. To summarize, Itsuki absorbs the spirit of the Hero-King Marth, and
he and the rest of the party fly high into the sky to confront the Shadow Dragon
while singing a song set to the melody of the Fire Emblem theme. Then it's final
boss battle time!

Medeus had some nasty tricks up his sleeve. One of his attacks had a chance to
cause Seal on the entire party, preventing them from using any Skills, and this
unfortunately affected every active party member at one point. I didn't have any
items to heal status ailments for the entire party, so I solved this by changing
out party members and using individual status ailment healing items. He could
also cause a unique "Burning" status effect. This was like a strong poison, and
dealt damage each turn while also making the character weak to fire attacks
while they were Burning. Other than the status ailments though, the battle went
pretty smoothly! There were two forms to the battle, but the second one seemed
easier than the first. What really helped I think is the Wyrmslayer skill I had
on Itsuki. It was a Sword type attack, but had the added benefit of starting a
Session against Dragon Mirages, regardless of their Sword resistance. And what a
coincidence, Medeus was a Dragon-type Mirage! I had Itsuki whale on Medeus just
about every turn with Wyrmslayer, leading to about a 9 combo Session each time.

With Medeus defeated, the Mirage attacks around Tokyo have stopped, and peace
has quickly returned. Of course, the public never knew they were in any danger,
and the party receives no recognition for saving the world. Typical, am I right?
Anyway, there's a little epilogue where you can speak to each party member and
get a final little dialogue scene with each of them. Most of them are wondering
what they'll do now that they don't have to fight Mirages anymore, but they're
all hopeful for their future with Fortuna Entertainment.

The credits roll, and I was a little disappointed they were just a basic text
crawl. No character artwork or even stills from the game's cutscenes in the
background. There was another original song that played during the credits
though, and it was alright. Afterward, each character gets a little "where are
they now?" style blurb that explains what they went on to accomplish. Itsuki's
is last, and consists of a little cutscene in addition to his text blurb, where
Maiko reveals that she's returning to her modeling career, and making Itsuki
Fortuna Entertainment's new president. Apparently, this is the "true" ending,
and I only got this one because I completed all the character side quests and
talked to everybody during the epilogue. I question whether a high school
student can properly run an entertainment agency, but other than that, it was a
good ending.

With that, my time with Tokyo Mirage Sessions was at an end. It was a lot of
fun! Like I said, the main plot didn't really go anywhere until chapters 5 and 6
and then it basically all happened at once, but this isn't really a game focused
on the main plot. Instead, it's way more focused on the characters, which were
all very enjoyable and had nice little character arcs in their side stories. I'm
really glad I picked this one up!
