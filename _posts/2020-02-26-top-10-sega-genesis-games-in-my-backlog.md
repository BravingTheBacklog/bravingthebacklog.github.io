During my childhood, my family had a Sega Genesis, or Sega Mega Drive as it's
known outside of North America. I remember playing Sonic the Hedgehog and its
sequel, even though I wasn't very good at them. But other than Sonic, I don't
think we had any games the console is remembered fondly for. Clearly I missed
out on a lot of quality games on the console. This list is all about fixing
that!

## 10. {% include game.html game="Shining in the Darkness" %}

Shining in the Darkness was a very early game in the console's lifespan. It's a
first-person dungeon crawling RPG, where you explore the game's dungeons with
your party, fight monsters in random encounters, and save characters trapped in
the dungeon. I haven't really cared for the gameplay of the previous dungeon
crawlers I've played, but I'm still curious to try this one since it's from a
series I haven't played before.

## 9. {% include game.html game="Battle Golfer Yui" %}

This game was only released in Japan, but luckily there's an English translation
patch for it [over on
ROMHacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/3364/) courtesy of
Supper, Filler, and Guest. The concept here is just too interesting! It's a Golf
RPG, where you play as a golfer girl who must fight against other golfers to
foil the world domination plans of an evil scientist. It sounds super unique,
and I've enjoyed the small amount of Mario Golf I've played in the past, so this
could be pretty fun.

## 8. {% include game.html game="Landstalker The Treasures of King Nole" %}

I don't know that I've heard of another platformer that uses an isometric
perspective, but that's exactly what Landstalker does. I've heard the
perspective makes platforming *a little* weird at times, but that it's still an
enjoyable game nonetheless. I'm hopeful that I'll enjoy playing through this
when I pick it up!

## 7. {% include game.html game="Gunstar Heroes" %}

Gunstar Heroes is heralded by many as a shining example of the run and gun
genre. It's full of frantic action, and has a unique sense of humor. You can
even play it in co-op, which could be fun for PatronusLight and I!

## 6. {% include game.html game="Comix Zone" %}

Comix Zone is a comic book-style beat 'em up. It takes place within the pages of
a comic book after the author gets pulled into his own work by the villain! It
sounds interesting, and I've heard some of the music from this game featured on
the Rhythm and Pixels podcast before, and I liked what I heard there!

## 5. {% include game.html game="Rocket Knight Adventures" %}

This one's an animal mascot platformer that I've heard really good things about
from YouTube! Or at least, from Austin Eruption. You play as Sparkster, a
sword-wielding, jetpack-wearing opossum. As Sparkster, you'll platform your way
through levels, slicing through enemies with your sword and blasting around with
your rocket jetpack.
 
Rocket Knight Adventures sounds like a pretty cool platformer, the jetpack seems
like it'll mix up the regular platformer formula a bit.

## 4. {% include game.html game="Streets of Rage 2" checkmark="" %}

**Edit:** I played through to the end with the help of an infinite lives cheat.
I'm not nearly skilled enough to make it through the entire game otherwise, but
I really enjoyed it! It's a tough but tight beat 'em up with a great soundtrack,
and I can definitely see myself playing through it again someday! [You can find
more of my thoughts on it here]({% post_url 2020-07-13-what-im-playing-no-80
%}#StreetsofRage2).

Part of the acclaimed 16-bit era beat 'em up series, Streets of Rage 2 is a side
scrolling beat 'em up. The player fights against many enemies in each stage,
utilizing weapons and special attacks to deal more damage.

Though there is a story here, I think I'll be okay jumping straight into the
sequel without playing the original game first. I'm mainly looking forward to
the gameplay and music here, as they're supposed to be top notch!

## 3. {% include game.html game="Shining Force II" %}

Shining Force II is a strategy RPG in a high fantasy setting, with knights,
healers, demons, and other fantasy elements. Gameplay is turn-based, and takes
place on a grid, similarly to other SRPGs like Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy
Tactics. Between battles, you can also freely explore towns and other areas.

With its combination of SRPG gameplay and town exploration elements, Shining
Force II sounds like it will be a pretty fun game, and it will be my
introduction into the Shining series!

## 2. {% include game.html game="Beyond Oasis" x="" %}

**Edit:** I gave Beyond Oasis a try, but it wasn't for me. It started out okay,
but I became frustrated with the difficulty spike around the halfway point and
decided to retire my playthrough. You can [read more about my thoughts here]({%
post_url 2020-07-06-what-im-playing-no-79 %}#BeyondOasis).

An action-adventure game said to feature gameplay similar to The Legend of
Zelda's 2D entries, Beyond Oasis puts the player in control of Prince Ali. Ali
finds a gold armlet, and learns that as the bearer of the gold armlet, it is his
duty to find and stop the wielder of the silver armlet, who will use its power
to cause chaos and destruction across the land.

This sounds like a classic struggle of good versus evil, and with the
Zelda-esque gameplay I've been promised, I'm looking forward to seeing how it
stacks up against the 2D Zelda formula.

## 1. {% include game.html game="Phantasy Star IV" %}

Phantasy Star IV is a classic turn-based RPG from the 16-bit era. I've played
some of Phantasy Star and Phantasy Star II in the past, but I've never played
the fourth entry in the series. Phantasy Star IV is regarded by many as the best
of the original Phantasy Star games. With all the hype, I'm definitely excited
to play it for myself!
