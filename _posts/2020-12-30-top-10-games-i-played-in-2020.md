This list was *tough* to make. I played so many great games in 2020 that it was
difficult to pick my favorites. I really liked all the games in this list, but
these are *far* from the only games I played this year. If I hadn't limited
myself to just 10, this list would probably be at least 20 entries long!

<!--more-->

A quick note, I'm not including games I re-played in 2020. So my Persona 4
Golden playthrough on Steam isn't here, since I originally played that on PS
Vita a few years ago. Also, I didn't include any of the games in the Super Mario
3D All-Stars collection, because I'd played 2 of the 3 games before on their
original systems.

Even though I'm not dedicating an entire spot to them, I want to include several
honorable mentions. Like the games that made the top 10, I really enjoyed these,
and each one was a serious contender for the list, only *barely* not making it.

*Honorable mentions*:

- Blasphemous
- Tokyo Mirage Sessions â™¯FE Encore
- Dragon Quest VIII
- A Hat in Time
- Gravity Rush Remastered
- Yakuza 0
- Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin
- Pikmin 3 Deluxe
- Luigi's Mansion 3

One last thing before we get on with the list, these are merely my favorites
among the games I played this year. These picks aren't meant to be objective in
any way. Onward, to the list!

## 10. {% include game.html game="Final Fantasy IX" platform="" %}

My first foray into the PS1 Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy IX was a
delightful JRPG. It took a little time for me to grasp some of the nuances of
the battle system, but I really enjoyed a lot of the battle mechanics. This is
an incredible JRPG, and the story has some powerful moments and twists that I
still find myself thinking about months later. Though my experience with it
wasn't wholly vanilla since I played using Moguri Mod, I really enjoyed it!

## 9. {% include game.html game="Resident Evil 4" platform="" %}

I knew of this game's legacy going in. It's often considered one of the greatest
action games of all time, and after playing it I can definitely see why. It's a
really solid game. There were a few slow moments, but it mostly consists of
heart-racing encounters against monstrous foes. It doesn't completely abandon
its survival horror roots though. I was afraid to go on a number of times
throughout the playthrough. Remembering the Regeneradores' rattling breathing is
enough to make me shiver even now.

## 8. {% include game.html game="Ori and the Blind Forest" platform="" %}

Another game whose reputation I was aware of going in, Ori and the Blind Forest
has incredibly positive reviews. I played the Definitive Edition, which further
polishes the experience, and found it to be a wonderful platformer metroidvania.
Like in other metroidvanias, I loved collecting new abilities that opened new
paths, and allowed me to acquire more health and other such upgrades. Combat
wasn't the focus here, but the platforming was excellent, with really unique and
satisfying movement.

## 7. Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair & Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony

  </ul>

Okay, I'm cheating a bit with this entry in the list, but I really couldn't pick
between Danganronpa 2 and V3, so...I picked them both, combining them into
one spot so I could sneak 11 games into this list instead of only 10!

Danganronpa 2 was incredible, full of great characters and jaw-dropping plot
twists. Danganronpa V3 was equally incredible, with more great characters, more
polished visuals and class trial gameplay, and with equally jaw-dropping plot
twists. I can't say enough how glad I am to have gotten into the Danganronpa
series. It's a bittersweet feeling having played all 3 of the main games with no
new entry in the series in sight, but I'm so happy I've played them all.

## 6. {% include game.html game="Zero Escape The Nonary Games" platform="" %}

A two game collection featuring the first 2 games in the Zero Escape series,
both of games in this collection were really good, but the game that really
earns it this spot is 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. 999 is an
incredible experience. I was charmed by the characters, voice acting, and sci-fi
story from the get-go. It was also pretty much the perfect length. It doesn't
overstay its welcome, but it's also long enough that it feels like a complete
adventure. My only real issue with the 2nd game, Virtue's Last Reward, is that
parts of it drag a bit. The puzzles in both games were excellently designed, and
that's another cool aspect that makes these visual novels stand out.

## 5. {% include game.html game="13 Sentinels Aegis Rim" platform="" %}

13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim is one of the best examples of video game storytelling
I've ever experienced. Vanillaware really pulled out all the stops with this
one, and accomplished something incredible. The non-linear storytelling here
couldn't be achieved in any other medium. Playing through each of the 13
characters' stories and gradually figuring out how they connected was extremely
satisfying. The light real-time strategy battle mode was reasonably fun too, but
the real highlight here is the story.

## 4. {% include game.html game="Hollow Knight" platform="" %}

I liked metroidvanias before I played Hollow Knight. I'd played Super Metroid
and Symphony of the Night beforehand, the foundational metroidvania games, as
well as a few other games in those series. Hollow Knight really ignited my
interest in the indie metroidvania scene though. Admittedly, it was a slow burn
in the opening hours of the game. Before too long though, I unlocked a few new
abilities and was hooked. Movement in Hollow Knight is a blast once you have all
the upgrades, and combat is likewise satisfying. It's a challenging game, with
numerous tough boss fights, and I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this aspect
of it.

It was only after playing Hollow Knight that I played through several other
indie metroidvanias this year, including Dandara, Ori and the Blind Forest, and
the aforementioned honorable mention, Blasphemous. Hollow Knight is really
something special, and I'm looking forward to Team Cherry's followup, Hollow
Knight: Silksong, whenever that releases!

## 3. {% include game.html game="Radiant Historia Perfect Chronology" platform="" %}

I had some complaints about this game. It has some flaws, and finishing the new
content all the way to the credits was tedious at times. However, the story and
gameplay mechanics here are incredible. It combines a medieval fantasy setting,
with a few high tech elements mixed in for good measure, with a story centered
around time travel and parallel timelines.

There are also numerous side quests, many of which include a choice between 2
options, one of which will lead to one of the multiple of bad endings. Unlocking
these bad endings was *so* much fun, as it really fleshes out the time travel
mechanic and helps you understand the main character's struggle. When you reach
one bad ending, you simply travel back in time to fix things.

As I mentioned, the battle system is also awesome, allowing you to move your
enemies on a grid to deal damage to stacks of foes at once. The soundtrack,
composed by Yoko Shimomura, is likewise fantastic, and complements the game
perfectly.

## 2. {% include game.html game="Gris" platform="" %}

Gris is such a beautiful and emotional game, and it doesn't even need to use
dialogue to convey its emotions. The gameplay is simple, with light puzzle
platforming elements, but it was a joy to play from beginning to end. Little
details of the gameplay made me smile, especially in unexpected situations. Gris
is an indie game I think everyone should play if they are able. It's short, but
well worth every minute of its several hour runtime.

## 1. {% include game.html game="Persona 5 Royal" platform="" %}

If you've read a lot of my posts, it's probably no surprise to see Persona at
the top of this list.

Persona 5 was not a short game, and Persona 5 Royal adds *even more* content on
top of that. PatronusLight and I did shared first playthrough of Royal, and our
final playtime when the credits rolled was 137 hours and 15 minutes. That's an
*enormous* amount of time, and definitely not the kind of free time everyone has
to spend on video games. But if you do, Persona 5 Royal is *so, so* worth it.

The battle system of Persona 5 was stylish and smooth, yet somehow Royal
polishes it even further. The soundtrack to Royal also features several new
tracks that are just as good as the original OST, including an awesome new
battle theme, and adds some much needed music variety to the randomly generated
dungeon crawling segments.

I got into the series with Persona 3, which is something of a meme itself in the
Persona community since a lot of fans, myself included, haven't played any of
the earlier Persona titles. That aside, since I started getting into the series
these games have always been special. No game has gotten me as engrossed as
these. The intermingling of school life and supernatural adventures just works
for me in a way that I haven't experienced anywhere else, and I'll always love
Persona 5 Royal for that!
