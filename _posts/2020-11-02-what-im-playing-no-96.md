Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Gris *(PC)*    {#Gris}

Gris is an indie platform adventure game, and I had the pleasure of playing
through it this past week. You play as Gris, a young girl in a vibrant,
fantastical world. In the game's opening, she is singing in the palm of a large
statue of a woman. After a few moments, she is unable to sing anymore, and the
statue crumbles away around her. As Gris falls, the colors drain away from the
world around her, and by the time she lands, everything has faded to gray. From
there, you control Gris as you explore her world, solving puzzles and doing a
bit of platforming.

Immediately, Gris impresses with wonderful 2D animation and art, as well as
excellent music and sound design. I played nearly the entire game with
headphones, and I definitely recommend playing this way. There is no dialogue in
Gris, either spoken or written. That said, there's definitely room for
interpretation in the game's story. Regardless, the music and artwork make it a
very moving experience. There were moments in Gris's journey that brought a
smile to my face, and others a tear to my eye, and the fact that it's able to do
all this without a single line of dialogue is very impressive.

</figure>

Gameplay-wise, Gris adheres to a pretty simple formula. It's a mostly linear
experience, though there are segments where you'll need to explore and collect a
few white orbs, which can generally be collected in any order. In this gameplay
loop, you'll explore, unlock a new area, gain a new ability, and then the
process repeats, with new areas requiring you to use your newfound abilities.
The puzzles and platforming are pretty simple throughout, but they were still
fun, and a few towards the end even took a few tries to figure out what to do.
Don't let the simplicity dissuade you though - the puzzles and platforming might
be simple, but that doesn't stop them from being delightful. The fact that the
environments are an artistic feast for the eyes definitely helps!

</figure>

I think I've gotten all the gushing-about-Gris out of my system. It's a short
but incredible experience, with my final playtime running just under 3 hours. If
it sounds at all interesting, I whole-heartedly recommend giving it a try!

### Pikmin 3 Deluxe *(Switch)*    {#Pikmin3Deluxe}

An port of the once Wii U exclusive Pikmin 3, Pikmin 3 Deluxe released for the
Nintendo Switch this week and I played through the entire main story between
release day and the day after! I'm a big fan of Pikmin, but despite Pikmin 3
originally releasing in 2013, I never played it since I didn't own a Wii U. So,
I've basically been waiting for this game, the followup to the amazing Pikmin 2,
since 2004. Playing a new game in this awesome, unique franchise was an amazing
feeling!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/M9xSPjr.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M9xSPjrm.jpg" alt="Pikmin 3 Deluxe"/></a>

</figure>

Like in the other Pikmin games, you play as some tiny spacemen stranded on the
strange planet of the Pikmin after their ship crashes. Unlike the previous games
though, you don't play as Captain Olimar in the main story. In fact, the 3
characters you play as aren't even from the same planet as Olimar! This time,
they're from the planet Koppai, and their mission is to find food on the
Pikmin's planet in order to save their home planet from starvation.

</figure>

Pikmin 1 had a strict, fixed time limit, while Pikmin 2 had no time limit.
Pikmin 3 seeks a happy medium between the two and brings the time limit back,
but this time it's not fixed, and is quite flexible. With each piece of fruit
your Pikmin army collects, you'll get juice that enables your crew to survive
more days on the planet, increasing your time limit. This fruit is also the
solution to their home planet's famine, as they plan on bringing the seeds of
the fruit back to cultivate on Koppai. This flexible time limit was interesting,
but I collected fruit fast enough that I had *plenty* of time, and the limit was
never a concern. It's a cool system though, and I like the way it makes sense in
terms of the story as well.

</figure>

That's not the only change in Pikmin 3 though - far from it! One of the most
notable changes is the addition of the Lock On system. In previous games, you'd
aim and throw Pikmin using only your targeting reticle, which required a bit of
skill, especially when things got dicey. In Pikmin 3, you could still play that
way if you really wanted, but it's far more effective to use the new Lock On
ability. When this is toggled on, you'll automatically throw Pikmin at the
target when you press A. Pressing the Lock On button again toggles between
nearby targets, so things can still get dicey when a lot of enemies are involved
as you'll need to quickly cycle through targets. The Lock On took some getting
used too, but overall I think it's a good improvement. You also can't move your
Pikmin around you using the 2nd stick anymore, but this isn't really an issue
because the Pikmin follow AI is better, and Pikmin don't get stuck on corners
and other terrain as much anymore. The only reason I miss 2nd stick Pikmin
movement is because I can't use my pro strat to throw Pikmin super fast
anymore - in the old games, you could use the C stick to position Pikmin closer
to Olimar, allowing him to throw them faster than normal!

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yLtrXbf.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yLtrXbfm.jpg" alt="Lock On"/></a>
</figure>

Another change makes the gameplay more like an RTS: the Go Here system. Since
you control 3 characters in Pikmin 3, you can get a lot done at once if you
micro-manage carefully. To help with this, the Go Here system allows you to
order one of your characters to move to the spot you indicate on the map
automatically. Once given an order, they and their Pikmin squad will march to
the location on their own, and they'll let you know when the reach their
destination. I *loved* sending Go Here orders, and once I had all 3 characters
unlocked, I was splitting into 3 teams and issuing move orders left and right!
It felt like this saved me *so* much time. One of my favorite things to do was
leave one character back at the Onion, then after I'd sent several Pikmin from
another character's squad back with treasure or monster carcasses, I'd have the
character left at the Onion grab all those Pikmin and set out with their new
squad to do whatever I needed them to do.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/S3S5NQQ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/S3S5NQQm.jpg" alt="the Go Here system"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/rKM4cRI.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rKM4cRIm.jpg" alt="monster carcasses"/></a>
</figure>

Last but certainly not least among the new features and changes, there are 2 new
Pikmin types in Pikmin 3: Rock Pikmin and Winged Pikmin. Unlike in previous
games, the only time Pikmin have their own Onion is the day you unlock them.
After that, their Onion fuses with the main Onion (the one that lands near your
ship each day), and you'll call all Pikmin types from their. This was a
surprising change at first, but it's honestly a lot more convenient, so I
definitely appreciated the change in the end! Anyway, the Rock Pikmin's
rock-like bodies can be used to break hard crystals and glass/plastic walls,
while the Winged Pikmin fly above the ground (as their name suggests). Because
they're flying, this means you can cross bodies of water with them. The Winged
Pikmin will fly above the water's surface while your character walks on the
riverbed. Since you're underwater and they can't swim, you can't grab and throw
them while crossing water, but this does allow you to reach some new areas
regardless. There are also Bamboo gates that you need Winged Pikmin to lift up,
allowing other types of Pikmin to cross. These are the only gates in the game
that aren't permanently opened. Instead, you need to leave some Winged Pikmin
assigned to them if you want to cross back and forth repeatedly.

</figure>

Of course the classic 3 Pikmin types, Red, Yellow, and Blue, all return as well,
and have the same abilities as in Pikmin 2: Red are immune to fire, Yellow to
electricity, and Blue can swim and breath underwater. One last interesting
feature: Pikmin can carry Bomb Rocks again in Pikmin 3. In the first Pikmin
game, only Yellow Pikmin could carry Bomb Rocks, and that was their special
ability instead of the electricity immunity. That was always weird to me and I
much preferred how they were electric resistant in Pikmin 2. Anyway, Pikmin 2
removed Bomb Rocks altogether, or at least the ones your Pikmin could carry.
They still existed as hazards in that game, but you couldn't use them. Well, in
Pikmin 3 they're back, and now all Pikmin can carry and use the deadly
explosives. It was kind of a nice surprise to see Bomb Rocks and the stone walls
they're used to break down again!

If I had any complaint about the main Story, it would probably be that it felt
pretty short. You also unlock Blue Pikmin very late. When I got the Blue Pikmin,
I was finally settling in with my complete Pikmin crew, but then the story was
over before I knew it! I had a lot of fun with the story, and I could have
played longer to collect more fruit (I certainly had enough juice left for
days), but I think if it was 1 area longer it would have felt a lot better.
Anyway, I cleared the story on Day 17, after just under 7 hours of playtime.
There's no post-game in the main Story like there was in Pikmin 2, but you can
rewind back to any Day of your adventure if you want to collect more of the
available fruit. I'll probably go back a day or 2 and try to collect all of it
at some point!

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0DKXIWw.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0DKXIWwm.jpg" alt="cleared the story"/></a>
</figure>

After the main story was finished, I moved on to the Side Story content. I
believe this was newly added for Pikmin 3 Deluxe. There are 2 short Side Story
arcs. You play as Olimar and Louie, the main characters from Pikmin 2, in both
arcs. These aren't freeform adventures like the main story, but are instead
missions with specific objectives and rankings depending on your performance.
They were pretty fun, but simple. They re-use maps from the main story, with
certain areas barred off and a few other changes made. It was cool to play as
Olimar and Louie, but other than that these didn't add that much in my opinion.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/odOmlAw.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/odOmlAwm.jpg" alt="the Side Story content"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5QcyFTc.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5QcyFTcm.jpg" alt="missions with specific objectives"/></a>
</figure>

I've really been enjoying the Missions mode. These are objective-based missions
like the Side Story content, but the challenge is higher, or at least the
rankings system is more strict. You also play as the main story's trio of
characters in these, and having 3 characters as opposed to just 2 is where the
multi-tasking, micro-management gameplay really shines. I've been taking on the
Battle Enemies missions, but there's also missions where you collect treasure,
and a third category where you re-fight bosses from the main campaign. This mode
is sort of like the Challenge mode from Pikmin 2, and I really enjoyed that mode
as well, so I guess it's no surprise that I'm enjoying this one in Pikmin 3 so
much!

Just one last note before wrapping up this post: Pikmin 3 Deluxe has in-game
achievements! I've said it before and I'll say it again now, I really like when
Switch games implement their own achievements. Sure, it's still not as nice as a
real achievement system tied to your user account like Steam achievements or
PlayStation trophies, but it's still nice to have some sort of achievement
system, and I love seeing the unlock notifications pop up during gameplay!
