### Paradise Killer *(PC)*    {#ParadiseKiller}

Holy moly, the aesthetic in this game is absolutely wonderful, and it makes a
killer first impression with its jaw dropping intro sequence.

Paradise Killer is a 2020 detective game that gives you the freedom to
investigate a grisly murder case how you see fit. The world is open for you to
explore from the very beginning, and you're free to collect evidence and speak
to suspects at your leisure, and you can choose to take the case to trial
whenever want. There's a suspect already in custody before your investigation
begins, and you can even choose to believe the official report and not
investigate anything if you want. There's even an achievement for speedrunning
the game and finishing it in under 10 minutes. I don't recommend doing that, at
least not before playing the game properly, but it's really cool that it's
designed in this non-linear way.

You play as Lady Love Dies, a member of the immortal alien-worshipping cult The
Syndicate, brought out of exile after thousands of years to solve the crime to
end all crimes on Island Sequence 24: the mass murder of the entire Syndicate
Council. With your trusty investigation computer Starlight in hand, it's up to
you to investigate the secrets of the island and determine who's guilty. As you
may have noticed from the use of the phrase "immortal alien-worshipping cult"
earlier, Paradise Killer has some deliciously weird lore to offer, full of
demons, psychic energy, and ritual bloodletting. At the beginning of the game,
you're dropped in and given free reign to investigate, but it's not just the
murder mystery you'll want to figure out, there's also have a whole island full
of lovecraftian-inspired lore waiting for you out there. The lore is almost like
a second mystery for you to solve, and makes exploring the island and talking to
the residents even more interesting as you start to understand more of how The
Syndicate and the island sequences came to be.

The mystery at play here is really deep. There's a lot of things to figure out
from the beginning, with more interesting twists popping up along the way. My
prime suspect changed several times as I found new evidence and heard new
testimony, and there were a lot of characters I was suspicious of at various
times for one reason or another. Due to the open-ended investigation mechanic,
there was a long list of leads to follow up on for a long time, and it seemed
like each one I followed kept splitting off into more leads and more secrets to
find, which was super cool. Gradually, I began to piece together might have
happened, but I still didn't feel content to go to trial until I'd followed most
leads to the end, and I'm glad I waited because then my picture of the truth was
even clearer when I headed to trial.

Exploration is really satisfying too. There are a few minor metroidvania
elements in the form of Starlight Upgrades that allow you to access new areas or
new pieces of evidence from hacking computers. There are even some movement
upgrades to unlock from several foot baths around the island, like a mid-air
dash and a double jump. The baths cost 5 Blood Crystals to use, which definitely
put me off using them at first as it wasn't clear what benefit, if any, they'd
provide. When I had more money later on, I finally gave one a try, and I can
tell you they're definitely worth it if you have the money to spare. The mid-air
dash was especially useful. You can use it to increase the height of your jump
by dashing upward in the air, allowing easier access to some collectibles and
areas, but it was also a really good way to move around the island quickly. By
looking slightly downward and jumping and dashing repeatedly, you can really zip
around! The game also feels a bit like a metroidvania in that you'll have to do
a bit of backtracking, whether it's to go back to someone you questioned before
to ask them about new evidence or about something someone else told you, or you
might have to go back to a computer you found earlier after you improve
Starlight's hacking ability. You hear about an area called the Dead Zone early
on, a quarantined part of the island infected with demonic corruption. You can't
enter it until you find a few Starlight Upgrades, which you probably won't have
when you first find the entrance. Once you get the upgrades and get inside
though, it's a really cool moment. The music in the Dead Zone is heavy and
foreboding, and the area itself is likewise foreboding and oppressive. As soon
as you step foot in there, you just *know* you're going to find something
important to the investigation, it's just a matter of finding out what.

On that note, the entire soundtrack really elevates the experience. The OST is
heavily inspired by city pop, and ranges from jazzy, upbeat bops to slower,
wistful electronic tracks. It's the perfect soundtrack for a tropical island
with a dark history. I love the juxtaposition of this island paradise and upbeat
music with the often grim practices of The Syndicate. I listened to the OST a
lot before I ever played the game, and it played a large part pushing me to pick
it up in the first place. There's a setting to change whether the music plays
from the speakers scattered around the island or from Starlight. Having it play
from the speakers might be more immersive since the music will fade in and out
based on how close you are to the nearest speaker, but I'd recommend having it
play from Starlight so you can listen to it all the time.

One thing that might turn some people away is this game's fast travel system.
You can fast travel around the island from any save point, but unlocking fast
travel at each of them costs money, and it also costs money each time you fast
travel. I didn't like this at first. In the beginning, I didn't have much money
to spare, so I never used fast travel because there were far more important
things to spend my Blood Crystals on. That's kind of the point of designing fast
travel this way. Early on, it's far better for you to walk everywhere as you
reach new parts of the island the first time or pass through earlier ones again,
because you'll probaly find hidden secrets or evidence that you missed before.
By the end of the game, I had more Blood Crystals than I knew what to do with,
and had already bought everything I possibly could, so I was fast travelling a
lot at that point. If you give this game a shot and find yourself annoyed by its
fast travel system, give it a chance. It really is designed to deter you from
using fast travel in the early game for a good reason.

As the developers themselves have said, Paradise Killer takes some inspiration
from the Danganronpa series. In the end, the two games aren't really all that
similar. Even if you like Danganronpa it's not a guarantee you'll enjoy Paradise
Killer, but there's definitely a few similarities between them. Exploring the
island reminds me of exploring Danganronpa's Hope's Peak Academy, because both
have you exploring a 3D environment in first-person to find clues, and the
characters show up as 2D cardboard cutouts. There's lots of items to find around
the island, some of it's evidence that will be added to your case files, but a
lot of them are blood crystals (the island's currency), or optional collectibles
like Relics or additional music to listen to. Finding these collectibles sort of
reminds me of finding hidden Monokuma dolls in Danganronpa 2, and the relics are
a lot like the gift items from the MonoMono Machine. You can also periodically
have a non-investigation related chat with each character using the Hang Out
option, which is sort of like Danganronpa's Free Time Events. Each time you do
this, your relationship with them will increase, and as you grow closer to them
they may divulge secrets they weren't willing to before, adding valuable
evidence to some of your case files. You have to wait a little while before you
can hang out with them again, I'm not sure if this is based on a timer or if you
just have to leave and come back though. One last similarity to note, instead of
having full voice acting, characters just have short voice clips that play
during dialogue. But while Danganronpa has full voice acting during its class
trials, the short voice clips are the extent of the voice acting in Paradise
Killer, but due to how the trial system here is designed it doesn't really lend
itself well to full voice acting anyway.

The trials themselves are pretty interesting. I didn't know what to expect going
into it. Would it have Danganronpa style mini-games or debates? It turns out,
no, it doesn't have anything like that. Instead, you go through each of your
case files one by one, and you can choose to accuse whoever you want for each
crime. Then you present the evidence you gathered, and Judge will decide whether
the accused is guilty or not based on that evidence. Anyone deemed guilty is
sentenced to death and executed at the end of all the trials. Whether they
*truly* committed any crimes is another story. That's all up to you to figure
out based on how thorough you were in gathering evidence. Although, some people
will confess to things after being convicted, so there is some direct
confirmation that you made the right choice, but it depends on the case file.
You can also deliberately choose *not* to present evidence for some of the case
files if there's anyone you don't want to implicate in any crimes. I played
through the trials twice, and the first time through I presented all the facts I
had gathered, and fully explained every mystery to Judge in court. In the end,
that resulted in guilty verdicts and executions that I believe were true to the
facts, but not morally correct. So, I played through the trials a second time,
and this time chose *not* to present some of the evidence I'd gathered for
certain case files, avoiding those executions that I didn't feel were necessary.

</figure>

That leads me to my one nitpick about Paradise Killer: you don't really get a
good sense of how your choices in the trials are going to affect the world.
After the trials, you can say farewell to characters who survived without
getting convicted, or choose to exile or execute them at that point, evidence be
damned, and then you leave the island forever to head to Island 25, and the
credits roll. I would have really liked to see some sort of epilogue for each
character or something, just something to give your actions a sense of weight.
Or maybe additional dialogue based on evidence you'd found, like some way to
tell characters, "hey, I found all this evidence but I let you walk free, what
do you think of that?" The consequences of your actions in this world are left
almost entirely up to your imagination and gut feeling. Still, even with this
lack of in-game resolution, I felt better about the outcome the second time I
played through the trials compared to the first, just due to my own feelings
about the characters, so maybe it is better they left any kind of concrete
epilogues out of the game.

Paradise Killer is a great detective game. The setting is really interesting
with an intriguing murder mystery to solve, and the investigative gameplay is
super addicting. I'm probably going to be listening to its soundtrack for a
*long* time, and every time I do I'll be reminded of all the cool moments I
experienced on Island Sequence 24. I highly recommend giving it a try if
scouring its open world island for clues sounds like your idea of a good time.
My final time was 13 hours 8 minutes.
