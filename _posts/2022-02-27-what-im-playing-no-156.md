### Yoku's Island Express *(PC)*    {#YokusIslandExpress}

Yoku's Island Express is a combination of two things that I never imagined could
come together this well: pinball, and metroidvania.

You play as a dung beetle named Yoku as he's arriving to Mokumana Island to take
on the job as the island's postmaster. One thing I couldn't get out of my head
when playing this game, I kept reading Mokumana Island as Monokuma Island by
accident, which would be a *very* different thing. Anyway, Yoku travels
everywhere with a perfectly round stone, rolling it around and getting pulled
around by it thanks to the tether connecting him to it. For some inexplicable
reason, Mokumana Island is filled with pinball paddles, which are *made* for
playing pinball with Yoku and his rock.

If you don't like pinball at least a little, you probably won't like this game.
You don't need to *love* pinball or have played other pinball games to enjoy it,
but if the idea of playing pinball disgusts you then Yoku's Island Express
probably isn't for you. I haven't played much pinball in my day, I remember
playing some 3D Pinball Space Cadet on an old version of Windows, but that's
about the extent of the virtual pinball I've played. I really liked Yoku's
Island Express though! The pinball mechanics are fun, and blending them together
with metroidvania elements is a really novel concept.

Primarily, you'll spend your time exploring the island, rolling and pinballing
your way around. The rest of the time, you'll be overcoming the various pinball
tables the game throws at you. These are integrated naturally into the world
map, but you can tell when one is coming because you'll pass through a little
tube to enter them. In the pinball tables, you'll have to either hit certain
precise targets, collect a few key-like items to open up the path forward, and
there's even a few *boss fights* in the game during these parts. Some of these
got a little challenging, requiring some specific timing in order to hit the
right targets, but luckily there's no game overs or life systems in the game. If
you fall to the bottom of the table into the thorns, you just lose a few pieces
of fruit - the game's currency, which is easy enough to earn back. There's no
need to be a pinball wizard to enjoy the game, which is nice.

Aside from giving you a large world to explore non-linearly, Yoku also earns its
metroidvania badge by featuring several abilities that you unlock throughout the
game to open up more of the world to you. Among these are the ability to dive
underwater, and another one that lets you slingshot yourself around. Plus,
there's a number of optional collectibles you can backtrack for once you're
fully upgraded, as well as several side quests. In light of all this, it really
feels like a metroidvania, but because of the pinball mechanic it definitely
stands out within the genre.

Plus, the art style is really colorful, and I like the painted look it all has.
The opening area is especially upbeat and charming, and the music helps a lot in
that regard. That said, there is diversity in both the environments and music.
It's not *all* bright and upbeat, with a few creepy and mysterious areas mixed
in here and there to keep things from becoming too one-note.

Once I finish a game's main story these days, I usually stop playing. Yoku's
Island Express was such a fun, fresh experience that I played a little more even
after finishing the main story. My final time for the main story was 4 hours 47
minutes, and after I went back into it to experience the joy of pinball again, I
had completed a few more side quests and gotten a few more collectibles, and my
final time came to about 6 hours 20 minutes. If the pinball metroidvania concept
sounds at all interesting to you, I recommend giving Yoku's Island Express a
try, it's a great time!
