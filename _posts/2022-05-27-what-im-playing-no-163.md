Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Prey *(PC)*    {#Prey}

I'm talking about Prey today, the one developed by Arkane Studios and released
in 2017, not the one by Human Head Studios that released in 2006. Although I
have played that one as well, a long time ago. Other than the name, Arkane's
Prey shares very little in common with the 2006 game. Set in an alternate future
on the space station Talos I, Prey puts you in the shoes of Morgan Yu, and
thrusts you into the middle of a crisis on the station. With a blend of
first-person shooter, RPG, and horror mechanics, the gameplay here is extremely
compelling, and once I started playing I couldn't get enough of it!

Things start out pretty normally. You start by picking whether to play as a male
or female character. You're supposed to be launched into orbit to work on the
Talos I space station with your brother Alex soon, but you have to go through a
few tests first. Things go wrong very quickly during these tests when aliens
appear and begin killing the examiners. Morgan is sedated, and they wake up back
in their apartment, but it becomes clear very quickly that what happened wasn't
a dream. You find a corpse in the hall, and a mysterious figure called January
calls and tells you that things aren't as they seem. January asks you to escape
your apartment so they can help you, and shortly thereafter you find out that
you've really been working on Talos I for the past 3 years. As the game
progresses, more and more of the history of Talos I and Morgan's role on it are
revealed, but I won't spoil any of that here. The introduction makes a great
impression, and it definitely left me wanting to explore and learn more about
what was going on.

One of the goals of Talos I is to research and develop Neuromods, devices that
allow you to instantly learn new skills. Neuromods could allow someone to who
has never studied medicine to become a neurosurgeon overnight, so it's
understandable that TranStar, the company who invented them and owns Talos I, is
heavily invested in their development. Of course, aliens attacking and killing
the staff on the station throws a wrench into those plans. These aliens are
called Typhon, and you'll be seeing a lot of them as you explore.

There are several kinds of Typhon, but most of the time you'll be seeing one of
two kinds. Mimics are little spider-like Typhon that can take the form of
anything they find laying around, from coffee cups to medkits. They're the
source of *many* jump scares throughout the game, and in the early game I was
pretty paranoid about running into them. The enemies you'll see most often are
Phantoms. These are bipedal monsters with loud, thumping footsteps. You'll hear
them before you see them a lot of the time, and they also cause the lights to
flicker when they're nearby. I was *horrified* of these things in the early
game, and the fact that I could *hear* them before I knew exactly where they
were made things so much scarier. Combat can be very intense too, especially
early on. Phantoms hit hard, so if you don't deal with them quickly, you'll
probably die. I was playing on Normal difficulty, and I died several times
throughout my playthrough.

Just like Arkane's other games, the "play your way" philosphy is in full force
throughout Prey. There are multiple ways to approach obstacles and complete the
objectives presented to you. For instance, if you find a locked door, you might
be able to get through by finding the keycard that opens it, or maybe there's a
maintenance panel nearby that you can crawl through to make it around to the
other side. That kind of situation and many others come up often while exploring
Talos I, and the systems within the game offer a lot of freedom of choice, and
creative thinking can get you into seemingly unreachable places where valuable
loot might be waiting.

There was a moment when I came across a locked security station and wanted to
get inside. I didn't *need* to get inside, but I wanted to see if I could. I
couldn't get through the locked door, but I realized that there were tiny
windows in the glass. After some trial and error, I realized I could use the
Mimic ability to transform into a small object, slide through the window, and
transform back. I love how Prey allows for solutions like that, and I would get
more use out of that same strategy later with other security stations, as well
as making it past barricaded doorways that were otherwise impassable.

Mimic is just one of many abilities and passive upgrades you can acquire through
the skill tree system. This is wher the Neuromods I mentioned earlier tie into
the gameplay. You collect Neuromods and spend them to unlock skills. There are
both human skills and Typhon skills available. The human ones can be unlocked
right away, but you won't be able to unlock the Typhon skills until you get the
Psycoscope, which you find pretty early on in the main quest line. Using the
Psychoscope, you can scan enemy Typhon to research them, and when you've scanned
enough of a given type, you'll be able to spend Neuromods to acquire some of
their Typhon skills. As you might have guessed, by scanning Mimics, you can
unlock the Mimic skill for purchase. Scanning Phantoms unlocks the Kinetic Blast
skill, which gives you the ability to trigger a powerful psychic blast that
damages enemies and moves objects in an area. Another Typhon ability I liked
using was Psychoshock, which lets you trigger a phychic blast against a single
enemy for decent damage. The human skills are split between passive upgrades,
like more health or inventory space, and upgrades that give you more options to
advance past obstacles and complete objectives, like hacking, repairing broken
items, and lifting heavier objects. There are several tiers of each of those,
and in the late game I got a *lot* of use out of the fully upgraded Hacking IV
skill.

As I've come to expect from having played several of Arkane's other games, the
level design here is top notch. Talos I feels very organic and believable, but
at the same time the levels are carefully crafted to allow multiple paths
through them. The station is composed of several large areas with loading
screens between them. In the beginning, you can only go to a few of them, but
eventually things open up and you have access to the entire station. You also
have many, *many* optional objectives you can complete, with more becoming
available depending on your choices and how much you explore. You might unlock a
side quest simply by finding and listening to a TranScribe that describes hidden
dead drops around the station, that kind of thing. I completed several side
quests over the course of my playthrough, but there was still a *long* list of
optional things I didn't do by the time I finished the game. There's a *ton* of
depth here, and if you're into it, there's also a lot of lore to be found.
There's plenty of books and emails to read, and you can learn a lot about the
station and the people who worked on it if you're interested.

While researching for this video, I noticed some interesting things about Prey's
voice cast. Many of them have had a lot roles on TV, in both voice and
traditional acting roles, in addition to video games, but for some, like
Benedict Wong, who voices Alex, Prey is the only video game they've ever been a
part of. I wasn't familiar with any of the people in the cast by name, but I'm
definitely familiar with some of the characters they've played and voiced over
the years. Here's a few of the cast members I found interesting: Mae Whitman,
who plays Roxie Richter in the Scott Pilgrim vs. The World movie, James Hong,
who voices Chi Fu in Disney's Mulan, and Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob
SquarePants. That last one blew my mind a little bit, never in a million years
did I expect to see the voice of SpongeBob in a game like Prey.

I really enjoyed Prey. It was a deeply immersive and rewarding experience. After
finishing the game, I watched the Noclip documentary on the making of Prey. They
interview several members of the development staff, and some of the games they
cite as having influenced Prey are System Shock as well as Arx Fatalis, the
first game ever made by Arkane. With how much I enjoyed Prey, I guess I really
need to play System Shock 2 at some point, but Arx Fatalis is definitely on my
radar now too! There's also the Mooncrash DLC for Prey that I'm looking forward
to playing in the near future. The backlog just keeps getting longer! My final
time for this one was 17 hours 31 minutes.
