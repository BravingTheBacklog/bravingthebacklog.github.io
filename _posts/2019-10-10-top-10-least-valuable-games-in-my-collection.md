After writing
the
[Top 10 Most Valuable Games in my Collection]({% post_url 2019-08-24-top-10-most-valuable-games-in-my-collection %}) post,
I became curious what the *least* valuable games I owned were. Or, if you want
to think about it the other way: what are the most worthless games I'm holding
on to?

<!--more-->

In general, most video games just aren't worth much the older they get. Of
course there are more than a few exceptions to this. Some games hit a certain
age and reach a nostalgic peak, then demand for them skyrockets, driving up the
price. But for most Xbox 360 and PS3 games, it really doesn't seem like they're
there yet, because most of this list is PS3 and Xbox 360 games! Although to be
fair, those are also the platforms I own the most physical games for.

## 10. {% include game.html game="God of War III" postfix="(US$4.54)" platform="" %}

God of War III is the 9th best selling PS3 game, according
to
[Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_PlayStation_3_video_games).
So many copies of it were printed and sold, it's no surprise that it's not worth
much these days.

When I bought it, I got it because it was under US$5, and I wanted to see what
the series was all about. Well, I still haven't played a God of War game, but
I'll get around to it someday!

## 9. {% include game.html game="Fable III" postfix="(US$4.49)" platform="" %}

I always liked Fable III, even though it may seem like a step backward from
Fable II in some ways. It was my introduction to the series though, so that
likely affects my opinion on it. I played it relatively close to launch, I
think. At the latest, I probably bought it a few months after it came out, so I
definitely paid much more than it's worth now!

## 8. {% include game.html game="Borderlands The Pre-Sequel" postfix="(US$4.38)" platform="" %}

I'm not really a fan of Borderlands, but for some reason I own this game. I was
tempted into buying it during a GameStop sale I think. Some form of "Buy 1 Get 1
Free" sale if I remember correctly. Of the games they had for the sale, I got
this, God of War 3, and Infamous 1 & 2 (more on those later).

My plan was to someday play this in couch co-op with a friend. To be honest,
there's a substantial list of couch co-op games I'd rather play, but maybe
someday I'll be glad to have a split-screen co-op capable copy of this game!

## 7. {% include game.html game="Gears of War 3" postfix="(US$4.36)" platform="" %}

I had a lot of fun playing Gears of War 3 when it came out. The
campaign was solid, and I even played the online multiplayer a bit and
enjoyed that as well.

## 6. {% include game.html game="Infamous 2" postfix="(US$4.29)" platform="" %}

As a well regarded series of PlayStation exclusives, I'm pretty curious about
the Infamous series. I haven't played Infamous 2 yet, since I want to start with
the first game.

## 5. {% include game.html game="The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Xbox 360" postfix="(US$4.26)" platform="" %}

I can't be the only one to find it interesting that Skyrim appears both on this
list and the Top 10 Most Valuable Games in My Collection list. Skyrim is
available on *everything* these days though, and since this is the launch
version on a last generation console, it shouldn't be a surprise the price has
fallen so far.

Meanwhile the Switch version, which appeared on my most valuable list, is only a
few years old, so its price hasn't fallen so far. Maybe around 2025 we'll start
seeing Skyrim for Switch in US$5.00 bins a game stores.

## 4. {% include game.html game="Yu-Gi-Oh! The Eternal Duelist Soul" postfix="(US$4.22)" platform="" %}

I've always had a soft spot for this game. My copy was given to me by a friend
back in middle school, and amazingly I still have it after all these years. I
never got into the physical Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, but I had a blast playing the card
game virtual on my GBA.

I only have a loose cart for this, so that might contribute to the low price.
But it is also a Yu-Gi-Oh! GBA game, and there's literally a dozen of those,
although a few are Japan-only.

## 3. {% include game.html game="Halo 4" postfix="(US$4.00)" platform="" %}

This is a game I'm almost sure I paid full price for. I probably picked it up
close to launch. Even though it came out just a little over a year after Skyrim
originally did, I feel like there was *so* much time between the two games'
releases. Maybe it's just because a lot was going on in my life at the time. I
graduated high school and started college around then, so life was pretty busy.

## 2. {% include game.html game="Infamous" postfix="(US$3.95)" platform="" %}

As I mentioned with Infamous 2, I picked this game up at the same time as the
second Infamous title, to give me a good starting place for the series when I
finally get around to playing them. No idea when that will be, but at least I
got a good deal on the first two games in the series...right?

## 1. {% include game.html game="Dance Central 2" postfix="(US$3.48)" platform="" %}

From the developers who brought you the Rock Band series: Dance Central 2, a
Kinect game for Xbox 360, and the least valuable game that I own! PatronusLight
and I got this game to play together, and we probably had some fun playing it at
the time. Kinect is sort of notorious for being a bad control scheme for games,
not recognizing what the player is doing sometimes, etc.. I can't remember if we
had those sorts of issues with Dance Central 2 or not...

Maybe we'll have to set up the Kinect again sometime and give this one another
try!
