Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection *(PS4)*    {#Uncharted:TheNathanDrakeCollection}

I played through the final game of this collection, Uncharted 3: Drake's
Deception, and it was another good treasure seeking, gunslinging adventure!

Unlike its predecessors, Uncharted 3's story sheds a bit more light on its
characters' backstories. Near the beginning of the game, you're treated to a
flashback of events from 20 years earlier, playing as a young Nathan Drake. It
serves to both show the player how Drake and his friend and mentor Victor
Sullivan met, as well as set up the main conflict of the game's plot. It was
really cool to see the origins of Drake and Sully's relationship, having spent
quite a bit of time with both characters in the previous 2 games!

Uncharted 3 brings new changes to melee combat, and these are introduced right
at the beginning of the game. Triangle is now your counterattack button, and
you'll be prompted to press it whenever you're in hand-to-hand combat with an
enemy and they're about to hit you. You can also grab and throw enemies by
pressing circle. At first I thought these changes were cool, but I kind of wish
they just kept Uncharted 2's combat system. Because circle is also the
dodge/roll button outside of hand-to-hand combat, there's not a quick way to
escape melee combat if you punch a guy and then realize you *really* shouldn't
be fighting him there since you're taking bullets from all around. The new
combat system made from some cool scripted encounters with big enemies a few
times during the campaign, but I didn't use it much in regular combat. One cool
addition to combat is the ability to throw enemy grenades back at them. You do
this by timing a button press when by a grenade, so it requires a little
concentration. It was really nice to be able to throw grenades back instead of
having to run from them all the time.

Like with Uncharted 2, I started on Normal difficulty but switched to Easy
midway through because I was tired of dying so frequently. I made the switch
when I was around one third of the way through, and I'm glad I did! I still died
plenty of times on Easy though...this was not an easy game for me!

I don't think Uncharted 3 is as good as the second game overall. It has great
moments, and the story is still good, just not quite as good as Uncharted 2's.
The finale was especially underwhelming compared to the final chapters of the
previous games. The music in this game is fantastic though. The score is
excellent and some orchestral pieces really elevate certain moments! This is
probably the best music of the first 3 games. I've now finished Uncharted: The
Nathan Drake Collection. I'm glad to have played it, and I've come to the
conclusion that I enjoy the series, but I'm not good at it.

### Forgotton Anne *(PC)*    {#ForgottonAnne}

Don't worry, that's not a typo in the title, although I'm still unsure why it's
"Forgotton" and not "Forgotten!" This is a story-rich indie game with light
platforming and puzzle elements, and beautiful animation. It's rather short (I
played it over the span of a day), but definitely worthwhile because the visuals
are stunning, and the story is pretty good too.

You play as Anne, the Enforcer in the Forgotten Lands. She upholds justice in
this strange world where objects that have been lost and forgotten in the real
world are magically whisked away and given life. As Anne, you'll encounter many
different Forgotlings, from talking shoes to talking chairs. Dialogue is fully
voiced, which is a nice touch, though several actors voice multiple characters.
Many times you'll have to pick between 2 choices during dialogue, and this
shapes the direction of your story to some extent. I don't think there are any
*huge* story branches in response to your actions, but your decisions are
referenced a handful of times.

[![Lots of puzzles revolve around figuring out where you can get an arca charge](https://i.imgur.com/o9d46Ddm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/o9d46Dd.jpg)

The platforming elements are rather slow. The controls are nowhere near as
snappy and tight as you'd want in a full-fledged platformer, but they're fine
here since the platforming is rather basic and never demands too much of the
player. The puzzle sections were much more well done. Many revolve around Anne's
arca, a device worn on her hand that lets her absorb Anima and dispel it into a
different container. You can only absorb Anima from something when her arca is
empty, and when it's full she can also jump much higher and further using her
mechanical wings. Lots of puzzles revolve around figuring out where you can get
an arca charge and what devices you can power with it, and I quite enjoyed
these.

Forgotton Anne is a beautiful game. There are so many great looking
environments. Screenshots really don't do the characters justice, because it's
the hand-animation that really makes them pop. It was a great experience! I
don't think I'll replay it, but after finishing the game you unlock a nice
feature called The Bridge that lets you rewind to previous points in the story
to play from there and make different choices. The platforming was bland, but
the rest of the game definitely made up for it!
