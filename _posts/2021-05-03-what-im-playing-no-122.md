Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Chrono Trigger *(DS)*    {#ChronoTrigger}

I played a *ton* of Chrono Trigger, and actually finished the game. That means
there's a *lot* to cover, but I'll try to stick with the highlights and my
overall feelings about the game.

In the first third or so of the game, your time travelling is done entirely
through portals that exist at specific places, and take you to specific times.
Eventually you gain access to a hub area that lets you more quickly navigate
between various time periods, but you're still limited to time travelling at the
specific locations where portals exist. Some time after that, you get your very
own time machine though, and once it's equipped with wings, you have *much* more
freedom. Not only can you fly anywhere in the world, you can freely travel to
any period of time in the game too!

At that point, the game becomes very non-linear. You're left to decide which
side quests you want to pursue, there's an optional main story branch you can
pursue, or you can just go fight the final boss in a few different ways. It's a
really impressive game design feat. The side quests available feel really
impactful too, they're not just throwaway "fetch me 10 of this item because I
said so" type things from an NPC, they feel like meaningful missions that have a
real impact on the game world. For instance, after defeating an optional boss,
you can choose to leave Robo, your robotic teammate, behind in the Middle Ages
so he can help with reforestation efforts. Doing so results in a desert in the
Present Day becoming a lush forest instead, and a shrine was built there in
Robo's honor. Since he's a robot, Robo is still alive after 400 years. You can
wake him up within the shrine in Present Day, and he rejoins you, so it's not
like he leaves the party forever. It's a really cool moment though, and really
makes you think about the power that your party has to alter the world's fate
through time travel.

The 2nd half of the game was definitely a *lot* more challenging than the first
half. Well, maybe not a lot more challenging overall, but there were some
*tricky* bosses that you really had to be strategic about. Some of these I
struggled on initially, getting multiple game overs to a pair of golem twins in
particular. They opened the battle with an attack that damages a character by
half whatever their current health was, following it up with a regular attack
that was killing or nearly killing my characters. That was overwhelming at
first, but then I realized I could put them to sleep, giving me time to heal my
party. Then I realized that their attack became either physical or magical
depending on the last attack you hit them with. Turns out they had high
strength, but really low magic, so they become pretty harmless if you hit them
with a magic attack before their action. They weren't the only boss like that,
there were a few others I initally struggled with before figuring out their
quirks. Figuring these bosses out was pretty fun actually, it's nice that some
of the bosses require strategy beyond just hitting them with your strongest
attacks repeatedly. It adds some variety to the battles.

The ATB battle system continued to grow on me throughout the game too. Overall,
I still prefer a more relaxed turn-based system, but the active nature of Chrono
Trigger's default system was exciting. Navigating the menus quickly to get an
extra attack in against an enemy, or trying to find the right healing item in
the inventory in time before they attacked and killed a party member always got
my heart pumping.

Chrono Trigger was a fantastic game, just super fun all around. I was afraid it
wouldn't live up to the hype, but I shouldn't have worried; it was just as
excellent as I was lead to believe. I am definitely open to replaying it
someday, maybe trying the Steam version (with mods) or the original SNES release
again. We'll see! My final play time according to my save file was 19:52, though
my actual final time may be a little higher since I don't know if that save
includes the time it took to beat the final boss and view the credits.

### Pathway *(PC)*    {#Pathway}

This is a roguelike published by Chucklefish that I actually bought and played a
round of only once before, right after it released. The game has been updated a
lot since then, but the last time I played was so long ago, I didn't really
notice the changes. It was sort of like I was playing the game for the first
time again. The premise of Pathway is that you basically go on several Indiana
Jones style adventures, filled with random events and encounters. You move
around a board, and each move consumes 1 fuel. Each move might trigger an event,
sometimes these are just choices while other times they're battles.

Battles are sort of XCOM-like, they're turn-based with an emphasis on cover and
gunplay. I've played 2 games with similar combat so far: Mario+Rabbids, and
Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden. It's probably not as deep as either of those
games, though to be fair I've only played Pathway for about an hour so there's
probably more depth to it in later adventures. In the end, I made it through the
adventure successfully, snagging some sweet loot that I can take with my
characters on future adventures. It was a fun run! I should make it a point to
play this game more than once every 2 years. One weird thing, the time taken
listed on the Statistics screen was 1:60:41...I think it was supposed to be
1:00:41, so there's some kind of time display bug there.
