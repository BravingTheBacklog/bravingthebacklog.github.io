---

Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

I focused mostly on finishing up the games I'd been playing lately, in
preparation for the English release of Persona Q2 on the 3DS! It's releasing
this Tuesday, June 4th, and I'm pretty excited for that! I say *mostly*
finishing up what I'd been playing, because as you'll see in this post...I
started another new game this week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Games contained within this post:

 - Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation *(3DS)*
 - Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! *(Switch)*
 - Parasite Eve *(PS1)*

### Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation *(3DS)*

I finished my Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation playthrough and with it, finished the last entry in the Fire Emblem Fates line!

At the start of the week, I was pretty near the end of the game. I was close
enough to the end that I didn't want to work on any more S Supports or child
units. I already had all the units I wanted. Some of my favorites in the end
were Velouria, who racked up a lot of wins in battle despite joining later in my
playthrough. Siegbert likewise impressed me for the same reasons, his only
weakness was his low Resistance but his high HP helped protect him. Xander
destroyed everyone in his path, as expected.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

A few maps toward the end had moving platforms that moved before the start of
each Player Turn. These platforms must be used to move between floating islands.
It was a neat gimmick, as you could engage the enemy from the platform, and then
it would move you to safety the next turn if you stayed on it. Or, maybe you
draw an enemy onto a platform, and *they* get moved away the next turn. Little
things like that made those maps pretty fun.

One of the last maps had a ton of enemies on it. My strategy to deal with this
was just to pull back a bit where the map was narrower. The enemies were rushing
me, but they could only engage a few at a time and quickly fell victim to my
elite kill chamber of powerful units.

Overall, I enjoyed Revelation a lot. I'm not sure if the final battle was easier
than Birthright's Endgame or if my party was just better and stronger. Either
way, I didn't have to retry it or the preceding chapter at all. I made it
through both the first time around without losing any units!

Story-wise, Revelation is definitely the most satisfying ending. It provides
closure for all the hanging threads left by Conquest and Birthright, and
everyone lives happily ever after. You

### Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! *(Switch)*

[![finished](https://i.imgur.com/BRc71ksm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/BRc71ks.jpg)
{: .image-right }

I finished Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! this week! By that I mean, I became
Champion of the Pokémon League. Of course, you can keep playing the game once
you've become Champion, and there is *some* post-game content. I'm marking this
one off as "Completed" in the backlog, but I'll probably keep playing it a bit
here and there.

In-game, no one knows who the Viridian City gym leader is. Even when challenging
the trainers in the gym they keep it a mystery. When you reach the path where
the gym leader waits, it's this big reveal when you find Giovanni there waiting
for you, and he's the gym leader.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/T669KrL.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/T669KrLm.jpg" alt="no one knows who the Viridian City gym leader is"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ASA1wPM.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ASA1wPMm.jpg" alt="Giovanni there waiting for you"/></a>
</figure>

Giovanni's team was a piece of cake. Eevee's Bouncy Bubble and Victreebel's
grass-type moves made short work of the ground-type team. The Earth Badge was
mine!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/f5F9GsW.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f5F9GsWm.jpg" alt="Giovanni's team was a piece of cake"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lnTHzW0.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lnTHzW0m.jpg" alt="The Earth Badge was mine"/></a>
</figure>

After leaving the gym, you run into Blue and he mentions how he'll be taking
over the Viridian City gym. This is kind of cool since he's the gym leader there
in the gen 2 Pokémon games.

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/meHkGFn.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/meHkGFnm.jpg" alt="he'll be taking over the Viridian City gym"/>
        <figcaption>Blue will be taking over the Viridian City gym</figcaption>
    </a>
</figure>

From there, one last obstacle stood between my team and the Pokémon League's
Elite Four: Victory Road. To get there, you pass through 8 gates, and a guard
checks for one of the 8 badges at each gate, only allowing entry to those who
carry the badge. I'd forgotten about this, but I believe this is how it worked
in the original games as well. I think this is a nice touch, it servers to
remind the player of everything they've overcome to reach this point in their
adventure.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/EavR4rQ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EavR4rQm.jpg" alt="only allowing entry to those who carry the badge"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/09tuwcD.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/09tuwcDm.jpg" alt="this point"/></a>
</figure>

Within Victory Road, I caught some new Pokémon, like Machoke, Exeggcute, Rhydon,
and the legendary fire bird Moltres. Like with Zapdos, there was a little
cutscene when Moltres is encountered.

<figure class="third">

    </div>
</figure>

In a rare stroke of luck, Moltres was captured by the first Ultra Ball I threw
at it!

    </a>
</figure>

Shortly thereafter I emerged from Victory Road on the other side, and had
reached the Indigo Plateau, home of the Pokémon League. I healed up my team,
then headed in to face the Elite Four!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/m3pPVjA.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/m3pPVjAm.jpg" alt="Indigo Plateau"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wnOWhi5.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wnOWhi5m.jpg" alt="Pokémon League"/></a>
</figure>

Lorelei and her ice-focused team were the first of the Elite Four. She
acknowledged that she met my guy earlier, mocked me for taking so long to reach
the Elite Four, then challenged me to battle.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZUvtzrx.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZUvtzrxm.jpg" alt="she met my guy earlier"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JhixxjM.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JhixxjMm.jpg" alt="challenged me to battle"/></a>
</figure>

Lorelei's team was a little bit of a challenge for my team. Many of her Pokémon
have a water type, but know ice moves. So Victreebel wasn't a good counter to
them. Nidoqueen's Thunderbolt would have been a nice option if not for her
weakness to water type moves due to her ground type. I made it by, but it was a
bit of a struggle.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/1JgBwxK.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1JgBwxKm.jpg" alt="Lorelei's team"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cBndi2J.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cBndi2Jm.jpg" alt="Nidoqueen"/></a>
</figure>

Bruno was next. His team was a piece of cake, I had a few good options to
counter him. Mr. Mime's fairy type Dazzling Gleam could exploit his fighting
team's weakness, as well as Fearow's Drill Peck. Fearow's Drill Peck was a nice
one hit KO on Bruno's Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan, and I had never been more proud
of my Fearow!

<figure class="third">

</figure>

Agatha and her poison and ghost focused team was the next obstacle in my way. Of
all the Elite Four (including the Champion), Agatha's team gave me the most
trouble. My Mr. Mime would have been a great counter for her entire
team...except since they added fairy type to him in gen 6, he's weak to poison,
which all of Agatha's Pokémon use to great effect. Through the use of several
healing items and lots of using Floof and his OP stats and attacks, I beat
Agatha. It wasn't pretty though.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/b2Wpybg.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b2Wpybgm.jpg" alt="Agatha"/></a>

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KYAtMHS.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KYAtMHSm.jpg" alt="Floof"/></a>
</figure>

The last of the Elite Four, Lance, is a master of Dragon type Pokémon. Even
though only one of his Pokémon was Dragon type. He wasn't trouble at all, I had
good counters to each of his Pokémon. I was a little worried about his Gyarados,
but Nidoqueen's Thunderbolt was a two hit KO on it, thanks to its 4x weakness to
Electric attacks. His Dragonite was possibly the easiest of all, since Mr. Mime
was made to destroy it with Dazzling Gleam.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

After beating the Elite Four, I was the Champion, right? Nope! Lance says
there's one trainer left to fight, then Professor Oak walks in. Lances announces
that the final trainer is Professor Oak! ...and then says he was just joking in
his next dialogue box. The game plays an awesome comedic audio cue there, it was
pretty funny. Game Freak definitely has a sense of humor.

    </div>
</figure>

The real final battle is the friendly rival. He's beaten the Elite Four just
ahead of me, so I needed to take him down to claim the Champion spot.

    </div>
</figure>

The championship battle against him was actually a lot of fun. His team has a
lot of different types. He also Mega Evolves his Pigeot! After it looked like I
would take down his Mega Pigeot, he surprised me by switching Pokémon before I
could deliver the final blow! *That* was cool to see, I don't remember anyone
else in the game switching Pokémon during battle.

</figure>

After taking down my rival's team, I was truly Champion of the Pokémon League!
Professor Oak entered the room, and I actually got a little emotional when a
remix of the Pallet Town theme started to play over this part. The way they
bring in the Pallet Town music was just so well done, and it really made me
reflect on the journey as a whole, all the way back to the very beginning.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3s6jSNI.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3s6jSNIm.jpg" alt="taking down my rival"/></a>

</figure>

My team was entered into the Hall of Fame. In my opinion, the team I've been
using isn't great. It could be better balanced, and it's lacking against some
type match ups (as Agatha's team proved), but I'm still happy with it. It was a
unique team for me, which is what I generally try to do when playing a Pokémon
remake.

<figure>

    </div>
</figure>

The credits for this game were absolutely *adorable*. I loved them.

</figure>

With the main game finished, the post-game content was now available. One new
piece of post-game content in the Let's Go games are the Master Trainers. Each
of these specializes in a specific Pokémon. They're located around Kanto, and
all you have to do is beat their Pokémon with your own Pokémon of that species.
This is easier said than done, I've heard their Pokémon are just *super* strong,
and you need to max out your Pokémon to beat them in the 1 on 1 battle!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dqVmmqF.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dqVmmqFm.jpg" alt="Master Trainers"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CM6vQvQ.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CM6vQvQm.jpg" alt="around Kanto"/></a>
</figure>

Another area is unlocked during the post-game, the Cerulean Cave. This existed
in gen 1 too, and is where you find Mewtwo. There's also strong wild Pokémon
inside to catch. I found and caught Lickitung, and Golduck.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/P1kXEoN.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/P1kXEoNm.jpg" alt="Cerulean Cave"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Q7Rdme0.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q7Rdme0m.jpg" alt="Lickitung"/></a>
</figure>

Mewtwo waits at the end of the short dungeon. Like the other legendary Pokémon
in Let's Go, you first have to defeat in battle in order to try and catch it. I
quickly realized that my team was *not* ready for this task. Mewtwo's Psychic is
*incredibly* powerful, and can 2 hit KO my Eevee. All my other Pokémon are one
hit KOs for Psychic, except for Mr. Mime. Psychic isn't very effective against
Mr. Mime...which prompts Mewtwo to use Recover to completely heal itself,
negating whatever damage I managed to do up to that point.

<figure class="half center">
    <div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(70.80% + 44px)'>
        <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/forkedscrawnyaardvark' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
</figure>

I wasn't able to catch Mewtwo this week, since you only get 5 minutes in battle
with it before it runs away and vanishes. I'll try again in the future. I think
I might need a Dark-type Pokémon, since Psychic won't have any effect against
them. Or maybe just reworking my strategy a bit will help.

### Parasite Eve *(PS1)*

Parasite Eve was recently featured in the first spot of
my
[Top 10 PS1 Games in my Backlog]({% post_url 2019-05-25-top-10-ps1-games-in-my-backlog %}) post.
I was looking for a shorter game to start this weekend, and I figured I'd stick
to my word and start a game that I'd said was one of my top priorities.

<figure class="half center">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Hocs9Df.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Hocs9Dfm.png" alt="Parasite Eve"/></a>
</figure>

Parasite Eve basically blends Survival Horror with a turn-based RPG. The result
is a pretty unique and fun game! You play as NYPD officer Aya Brea during a
fictional 6 day incident in 1997 where some wacky stuff happens. The bad guy
here is Eve, a woman who has been taken over and mutated by her mutant
mitochondria. Yeah, the premise here is that mitochondria in the human body
mutate and kind of become sentient and evil, I guess? Anyway, Eve wants to kill
all the humans by making them spontaneously combust. Luckily Aya is immune to
this, so it's up to her to save the day!

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bGrZRW7.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bGrZRW7m.png" alt="NYPD officer Aya Brea"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VkoKnXc.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VkoKnXcm.png" alt="6 day incident in 1997 where some wacky stuff happens"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/g1LgQqb.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/g1LgQqbm.png" alt="Eve"/></a>
</figure>

The script is just full of the word "mitochondria." Most of the main characters
talk about it at least once.

<figure class="third">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PGDbEL5.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PGDbEL5m.png" alt="The script"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FMj9BhZ.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FMj9BhZm.png" alt="mitochondria"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3mU97dR.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3mU97dRm.png" alt="Most of the main characters talk about it at least once"/></a>
</figure>

Battles pop up randomly as you run around the environments as Aya. In battle,
you can freely move while your AT bar refills, and you can use this movement to
dodge enemy attacks. You battle creatures that Eve has mutated into grotesque
forms. Once your AT meter is full, you can attack using your equipped weapon,
which is usually a gun. A green wireframe orb shows the range in which your
attacks will hit, so you need to be close enough to the enemy to hit them, but
not too close that they can easily hit you. This makes battles pretty fun once
you learn enemy attack patterns, as dodging comes down to managing your distance
and knowing what the enemy's attacks are like.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WfgZqZh.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WfgZqZhm.png" alt="freely move"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4FXbUoo.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4FXbUoom.png" alt="which is usually a gun"/></a>
</figure>

The survival horror bits come in due to the grotesque nature of the enemies.
Some of these, mostly bosses, get pre-rendered FMV cutscenes depicting their
transformation from animal to monster. The other survival horror feature is
managing your ammo and scavenging for supplies. In the early parts, I was
running out of ammo *constantly*, and had to beat down a lot of enemies with a
club since I didn't have any bullets.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wyL1x9z.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wyL1x9zm.png" alt="their transformation from animal to monster"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VEFDuvS.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VEFDuvSm.png" alt="had to beat down a lot of enemies"/></a>
</figure>

Early on the game was pretty hard, I got a few Game Overs. After Day 2 though,
it seemed like supplies and good weapons became way more readily available, and
I stopped getting Game Overs from random enemies! Now that I found a Grenade
Launcher, I seem to be basically unstoppable.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CgNIcx8.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CgNIcx8m.png" alt="Game Overs"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DcETwaS.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DcETwaSm.png" alt="Grenade Launcher"/></a>
</figure>

My plan is to finish Parasite Eve early this week, because Persona Q2 comes out
*tomorrow* and I want to be able to devote all my time to that! Maybe it was a
little silly of me to start a brand new game right before PQ2 came out, but I
think I'll be able to finish Parasite Eve pretty quickly now. It is a pretty
short game!
