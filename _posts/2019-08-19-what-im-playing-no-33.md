Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Since Fire Emblem: Three Houses is such a new game, I have been careful to keep
spoilers out of my writing and screenshots here. Nothing here should spoil
anything about Three Houses' plot!

Games contained within this post:

 - Fire Emblem: Three Houses *(Switch)*

### Fire Emblem: Three Houses *(Switch)*

I finished another path through the game! This one is actually like a 4th path.
During my Black Eagles playthrough, there was a moment when the game offered a
choice and warned that the decision would drastically affect the rest of the
game. Naturally, I made my choice and created a new save afterward. That allowed
me to load my old save, and choose the other path, which is what I finished
playing through this week!

Again in the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'm not going to talk about anything
specific in this path, but just give some non-spoiler highlights.

Instead of making her a Gremory, this time I made Dorothea a Mortal Savant,
which is basically a unit that specializes in swords and black magic. Dorothea's
low strength meant that swords weren't that useful on her, but maybe she'd have
had higher strength if I'd had her on combat classes earlier in the game instead
of magic classes? I think a unit's class does have some impact on their stat
growths.

Oh, also I let Linhardt die. I'd placed him on an unsafe space, and sure enough
the enemy took advantage of that. Rather than undo my actions and have to replay
most of the previous turn though, I just thought "eh, oh well," and let it
happen. Dorothea, Mercedes, and Lysithea were the stronger mages, and Mercedes
was far better at healing than Linhardt. Not a big loss, in my opinion. Sorry
Linhardt fans!

I chose Petra for the S Support for that playthrough. She and Worm got married and lived happily ever after, etc..

Lastly for this playthrough, here's a couple no context, spoiler-free
screenshots from this path.

Of course, Three Houses is so fun that I couldn't stop there though, and decided
to start New Game+ using the clear data from my Black Eagles playthrough! New
Game+ basically unlocks a special shop where you can spend the Renown you earn
to unlock stuff you unlocked in your previous playthrough, but by spending the
Renown you're most likely unlocking these items much earlier than you otherwise
would.

I chose the female character for this playthrough, and named her Wormette.

My house choice this time is Golden Deer. They're an interesting group.

[![Lysithea](https://i.imgur.com/GO9SdVsm.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/GO9SdVs.jpg)
{: .image-right }

For one, Lysithea starts in Golden Deer, and I believe she has the highest magic
stat growth in the game. I didn't recruit her until late in my prior
playthroughs, so I'm interested to see how powerful a magic user she will be
over the course of an entire playthrough.

Hilda has been quite charming, surprisingly. In my prior playthroughs, I didn't
talk to her much because it seemed like she never wanted to talk. She'd have
some lines of dialogue when I spoke to her on my Black Eagles run, but the
option to Recruit her or give her gifts rarely popped up. Maybe it's because
she's so lazy? I'm interested to see what additional aspects of her backstory
and personality are shown off in her higher rank Support conversations.
Similarly to Charlotte in Fire Emblem Fates, she makes herself out to be
defenseless in battle and yet is quite strong, and seems naturally suited for
the Warrior or other axe-wielding classes.

Lorenz is another Golden Deer who I hadn't really interacted with at all in my
prior playthroughs. On the surface he seems like your stereotypical stuck up
noble, but this has lead to some pretty hilarious lines from him. He's giving me
very similar vibes to a character from Trails of Cold Steel, Jusis Albarea.
That's probably mostly due to both characters being voiced by Ben Diskin in
English, but they're also both nobles who initially come off as snooty.

There are a few other Golden Deer students as well. There's the quiet Marianne
who I don't know very well yet but I suspect she has quite a tragic backstory.
Raphael is also in this house. He's a character I disliked on my first
impression of him during my prior playthrough, but he's grown on me a little bit
I guess. He's still my least favorite Golden Deer, but I'm hoping he makes for a
good armored knight in battle. There's also the bespectacled Ignatz, who seems
destined to be the Archer/Sniper of my team, and Leonie, who I've made into a
Pegasus Knight. The Golden Deer house is just as varied a group of characters as
the Black Eagles were, and it seems both houses have plenty of fans online, so
I'm looking forward to getting to know all these characters better as my
playthrough progresses.

Since I'm doing a New Game+ run, I've been spending Renown to unlock Support
Ranks with characters that I had that level of Support with in my previous
playthrough. This, coupled with the fact that I also spent Renown to retain my
Professor Level, means recruiting characters from other houses is a breeze.
Mercedes asked to join my house, I recruited Felix the first time I asked him
about it, and Ferdinand asked to join out of the blue as well. Afterward, I got
Caspar, Petra, and Bernadetta as well! So nearly every Black Eagle student has
joined the Golden Deer. On top of that, Sylvain, who I had no Support with at
all, asked to join, and who am I to say no? So my house is growing pretty large,
though to be honest I'm definitely prioritizing using the students who started
out in Golden Deer in battle, to get more familiar with them and what they're
good at. The exception to that is Felix, who is such a killer swordsman that I
need to use him basically all the time!

Let's close off this post by showing off Claude, leader of the Golden Deer, as
he advances to the Lord class. Claude is a pretty cool character, I passed over
him initially due to his carefree facade, but he's actually revealed to be quite
a strategist. He's always got a trick up his sleeve. And also, his Lord outfit
looks pretty sweet!
