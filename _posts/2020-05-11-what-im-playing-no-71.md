Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that section.

### Persona 5 Royal *(PS4)*    {#Persona5Royal}

I finished my New Game++ playthrough! The total play time for our original
playthrough, PatronusLight's New Game+ playthrough, and now this playthrough was
259 hours. My New Game++ playthrough only accounts for 38 hours of that though,
and that's a time I'm happy with. It was fun playing through Persona 5 Royal so
"quickly!" It's definitely not speedrun record material though. It would need to
be about half as long to even come close.

Finally got 100% Award completion in the Thieves Den! This earns you the ability
to summon Personas from the Compendium for *free*, and also gives you an
accessory that makes you invisible to enemies in the overworld if you equip it,
letting you avoid battle extremely easily if you want to. These are really cool
completion bonuses! They're really overpowered, but at this point it doesn't
really matter since between PatronusLight and I this is our 3rd playthrough of
the game in New Game+, and we were already super overpowered anyway.

Now there should only be a few items we don't have unlocked in the Thieves Den.
As far as I know, we can unlock them all by completing the game with the
original Persona 5 ending, which is something PatronusLight plans to do soon.

### Undertale *(PC)*    {#Undertale}

[![Undertale](https://i.imgur.com/m2pDO8Em.png)](https://i.imgur.com/m2pDO8E.png)

I played through Undertale for the first time this week, and hoo boy what a
game. It's surreal, surprising, hilarious, and heart-wrenching at various times.
Your choices matter at various points in the game, and I was surprised at how
much regret I felt at some of the decisions I made. I think it's the kind of
game best gone into without any prior knowledge, like I did, so I won't fault
anyone who hasn't played it skipping the rest of this section!

The premise of the story is pretty simple. You control a human child who falls
into the underground world of monsters, where they were sealed long ago after an
ancient war between humans and monsters. One of the first monsters you encounter
is the motherly Toriel, who takes you under her care. Thus begins your journey
in the world of monsters!

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NEq72tO.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NEq72tOm.png" alt="Toriel"/></a>
</figure>

Battles in Undertale are pretty unique. You have several options in battle, the
first of which is Fight. Fight brings up an interface where you time a button
press to stop the vertical line near the center of the screen to deal more
damage. I really like this kind of timed action in other turn-based RPGs, as it
adds nice interactivity to combat.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VOvGLJH.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VOvGLJHm.png" alt="Fight"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VOvGLJH.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VOvGLJHm.png" alt="time a button press to stop the vertical line"/></a>
</figure>

In Undertale though, you don't have to use Fight most of the time if you don't
want to. There are also "Act" options that differ depending on what enemy you're
targeting. For instance, you can try talking to or complimenting some enemies.
Doing so may allow you to Spare them using the Mercy. The last and perhaps
largest part of combat is dodging enemy attacks, which plays sort of like a
bullet hell mini-game. You control a red heart during this, and must dodge the
projectiles and weapons the enemies throw at you. Each enemy type has several
unique attack patterns, which keep this part of combat feeling fresh. It also
leads to some intense and hectic boss battles!

Like other RPGs, Undertale features quite a bit of exploration and puzzles.
You'll explore a wide variety of locales on your journey, filled with NPCs with
interesting and bizarre dialogue. On that note, it definitely feels like it
takes a page from Earthbound's book. Some of the NPCs and situations are just so
surreal, the only other game I've seen that does anything like them is
Earthbound. Many of them brought a smile to my face, simply because they were so
unexpected. Undertale subverts expectations to great comedic effect many times.

</figure>

The flow of the game is primarily explore, solve puzzles, and fight bosses, with
a few random encounters thrown into the mix between parts. The puzzles might
start out quite basic, but there were a few that required me to think pretty
hard near the end. All were well designed though, and it was fun working through
the more difficult ones.

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/A5MEUn6.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/A5MEUn6m.png" alt="quite basic"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/f0ugj4x.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f0ugj4xm.png" alt="more difficult ones"/></a>
</figure>

Also, there's some awesome music in this game! Every boss battle is made
especially epic due to the great unique tracks that play during them. My
personal favorite was Spider Dance, which plays during one of these great boss
encounters!

Undertale is pretty short, which is good because you'll probably want to play
through it multiple times to see different endings. I have a feeling it will
stick with me for a long time. It's just such an emotional journey. I smiled, I
felt regret, and I was moved to tears, all within the span of its 4 to 6 hour
playtime. I didn't get the "true/good" ending though, and to do so on my save
I'd have to replay the game from the start. I started a second playthrough, and
played through a few choices I'd regretted the first time around, this time
making choices I feel good about. I'm feeling content with the Undertale I've
played for now though, so I don't plan on finishing a second playthrough right
now. Instead, I've read the endings section on the Undertale Wikia, and watched
some videos of the ending on YouTube. The true ending is definitely worth
seeing, so I'm really glad I looked it up!

### Final Fantasy IX *(PC)*    {#FinalFantasyIX}

I started playing the Steam version of Final Fantasy IX this week! The Steam
version released in 2016, but the game originally launched on the original
PlayStation in 2000. I missed out on that version, but I'm finally experiencing
it now on PC!

<figure class="half center">

[![blurry](https://i.imgur.com/8l6n6jim.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/8l6n6ji.jpg)
{: .image-right }

First off: a disclaimer. I have no problem with PS1 pre-rendered backgrounds. I
find them to be quite charming. Final Fantasy IX uses pre-rendered backgrounds
and fixed camera angles for all non-World Map areas. With this port, the 3D
character models are a rendered at whatever you set your display resolution to,
while the original pre-rendered PS1 backgrounds are simply upscaled to fit this
resolution. In my case, this is 1080p. I like how these models look at 1080p,
but the backgrounds looked a blurry in comparison. I bet it looks great on a
PS1, and I sort of wish the Steam version had a mode that let you render the
models at original resolution and maybe even imitate the PS1's iconic rendering,
so that the 3D models would be pixelated and display as originally intended.

Since that's not an option though, I did some Googling and chose to check out
"Moguri Mod," which does quite a few things, but namely replaces all the
pre-rendered backgrounds with HD pre-rendered backgrounds upscaled from the
originals using a machine learning technique called ESRGAN. The look of these
sometimes varies, with some looking sharp and beautiful, and others having a
more painted look, but I like them either way. I played just about an hour of
the game before deciding to look up mods, so some screenshots will likely look
noticeably different since they were taken before I installed Moguri Mod. Moguri
Mod is built upon Memoria Mod, which adds some nice quality of life options to
the PC port, like a widescreen option instead of the original 4:3 aspect ratio.
It also lets you adjust the FPS during battles, which is at 15 FPS by default.
That felt really sluggish and choppy to me, but I'm sure it was faithful to how
it ran on PS1. I increased the battle FPS to 20, and found that it feels a lot
better.

Anyway, as far as the actual gameplay, story, and characters go, I'm really
enjoying things so far! My experience with the Final Fantasy series is pretty
limited. In the main series, I've only finished Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of
Souls on the GBA, but I also played Final Fantasy III and IV on the DS, but I
never finished those. Final Fantasy IX reminds me of the entries I've played in
that it lets you name all the characters in your party. I've stuck with the
default names so far. There's Zidane, the "Tailed Human" thief. He has a monkey
tail. Vivi, a young Black Mage, Steiner, a royal guard captain, and Dagger, who
is really the runaway princess Garnet and seems to be the White Mage of the
team.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

The opening makes quite an impression. It's full of FMVs that show off a theatre
troupe airship soaring through the air and docking at Alexandria Castle, and
also serves as opening credits, displaying the names of prominent members of the
development team. The airship belongs to Tantalus, who are a group of thieves.
Zidane is a proud member, and is a key figure in the mission they're planning to
undertake: kidnapping Princess Garnet! The mission goes awry when Zidane
discovers Princess Garnet has decided to run away from the castle, and she
actually wants him to kidnap her. The confusion that ensues causes Queen Brahme
to discover their plot. As their airship takes off with Garnet, Vivi, and
Steiner on board, the Queen tries to shoot it out of the sky. They escape the
city, but with the damage their ship sustained it soon crashes in the Evil
Forest. Thus, your initial party of four band together.

As far as the battle system goes, I'm still getting the hang of parts of it. It
uses the Active Time Battle (ATB) system that several prior Final Fantasy games
used as well. In this system, you can only choose an action for a character when
their ATB guage is full. The same applies to enemies I think, but you can't see
thair ATB meters as far as I know. The ATB meters fills as time passes, but time
pauses when you're in menus picking items or magic, at least when using the
"Wait" setting. You can also change it to "Active," which makes time pass even
when in menus, but that's only recommended for advanced players and that
definitely doesn't describe me at this point! I died several times to early game
bosses. I wasn't prepared for how carefully I'd need to watch my health and
actively heal my characters using items. Like I said, I'm still learning the
ropes of the ATB system, but it's been enjoyable so far!

<figure class="third">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OBKqAjF.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OBKqAjFm.jpg" alt="died"/></a>
</figure>

Abilities in Final Fantasy IX are pretty cool too. Many pieces of equipment
provide access to Abilities while equipped. Certain abilities can only be
learned by certain characters though. Like, Zidane can't learn magic abilities,
but Vivi can because he's an awesome mage. A character can learn these abilities
to make them permanently available by gaining AP through winning battles. Once
an ability is learned, you can equip that ability to the character without
needing the equipment. Characters can only equip so many Abilities at a time, as
determined by their max AP pool. This system reminds me a lot of how Abilities
in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance work, and it's incredibly likely that FFTA's
system was heavily inspired by FFIX. If Abilities in FFIX offer as much
flexibility as the system in FFTA, it's sure to be amazing by the late game!

That's about it for my time with Final Fantasy IX so far. It seems like it will
be a really nice RPG experience, and I'm looking forward to seeing where things
go!
