### Persona 5 Royal *(PS4)*    {#Persona5Royal}

Given the staggering size of my backlog, I should really focus on playing new
games instead of replaying ones I've already played. So naturally, I started a
new playthrough of Persona 5 Royal again. My initial plan was to play through on
Merciless difficulty, but I gave up on that because it was probably not possible
given the other self-imposed constraint for this playthrough. I'm also letting
the AI control all my companions, and leaving them on the "Act Freely" setting,
where they do whatever they decide is best in battle rather than being directly
controlled. This means they might not guard in battle when the enemy is charging
up a powerful attack, and they've died a lot so far. I ended up changing the
difficulty to Hard instead, and it's been pretty fun so far!

I've also named my character "Yuuki Mishima," the same name as another character
in the game. I've enjoyed seeing the name pop up in dialogue, because while it's
usually obvious who they're talking about, I enjoy the slight ambiguity. My
favorite moment so far was when other-Mishima says the player character's
name...it was great!

### Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked *(3DS)*    {#ShinMegamiTensei:DevilSurvivorOverclocked}

After a bit of grinding and reorganizing my main character's demon team, I beat
Beldr. Being a few levels higher and having the proper demons for this made it
*really* easy actually, so I'm glad I followed the recommendation I saw on a
GameFAQs post! After the fight, Yuzu spoke my greatest fear, wondering if
another fight like Beldr was waiting for me down the road. I'm pretty sure there
will be more tough boss fights, but I haven't reached them yet!

As my characters level up, I'm able to fuse better demons. One of these is
Ishtar, who has no weaknesses and is an excellent healer. Lucifuge is pretty
good too. It has Agidyne, which deals a ton of fire damage, and makes a good
addition to my main character's magic-focused team. I was excited to fuse Odin
because he's pretty good in the Persona games I've used him in, but he's kind of
underwhelming in Devil Survivor. His stats are good, but he doesn't have any
magic skills. I should have fused him from better demons so I could have had him
inherit some magic skills.

The main story is really going places now. For a while, I thought the story was
just alright, but the longer the lockdown goes on in-game, the more interesting
things become. Riots have broken out, characters have forged pacts with powerful
demons via sheer willpower, and characters have died. I'm *somewhat* certain
that I could have prevented a character death, but then I think a different
character would have died instead. Maybe there was a way to save both of
them...? I'm not sure, but I'm fine with the way things played out because it
made the story really interesting. We also finally caught up with the player
character's cousin, Naoya, who knows a lot about what's going on but keeps most
of that to himself. You do get some answers from that meeting though, and it
seems to foreshadow some upcoming choices where I imagine I'll be set on the
path to one of the game's various endings.

That's about it really. Battles have been as fun than ever, but are still
essentially the same as how I described them last week. It's cool having
stronger characters and demons in battle though, that's always a fun part of
RPGs! I'm on the 6th day now. The original game had 7 days, and I know
Overclocked adds an 8th day, so I'm getting closer to the end bit by bit.
