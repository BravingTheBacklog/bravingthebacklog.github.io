Welcome back to another weekly wrap-up of the games I've been playing over the
past week!

Be warned, minor spoilers may be contained within. Generally, I do *try* to keep
things spoiler-free but this isn't always possible/practical! If you want to
totally avoid all potential spoilers so you can play these games yourself in a
blind run, you shouldn't continue reading! Click a title to skip to that

### Rune Factory 4 Special *(Switch)*    {#RuneFactory4Special}

My Rune Factory playtime was filled with more farming bliss, and I also made
some headway in the main story's second arc.

I won't go into spoiler territory for the main story. It's involved more dungeon
exploration, and several more boss fights. I've begun bringing some of the
townsfolk with me on my adventures, to form a little party. I'm partial to Dolce
as a companion, and doubly so after realizing that your followers sometimes have
unique dialogue during certain story events. At one point, Dolce made a Pokémon
reference, and it was then I knew she and Worm must marry. Her English voice is
performed by Laura Bailey, who also voices Serana in Skyrim's Dawnguard
expansion, so that's pretty cool.

Another festival involving a mini-game was held: the eating contest. The goal
was, naturally, to eat the most food. You accomplish this by picking up food
items that fall from the sky and mashing a button to eat them. Each food item
you eat earns you points, and prepared dishes such as grilled fish are worth
more points. I made up for my failures in previous festival mini-games by taking
first place in this one! I'd like to thank the Mario Party series for giving me
the button mashing experience I needed to pull off this win.

### Metal Slug 3 *(PC)*    {#MetalSlug3}

I'd played some Metal Slug 3 on an emulator before, and really enjoyed it. This
week I saw the Metal Slug Anthology for a good price, and decided to get it to
add them to my Steam library. These releases on Steam are presumably using
emulation as well, but are official releases. The Anthology I bought contains
Metal Slug 1, 2, 3, and X, which I don't think is a roman numeral 10 but is just
a capital letter "x."

</figure>

Anyway, not much to say on Metal Slug 3, just that I'm enjoying it! It's a run
and gun game developed by SNK that originally released in 2000. Where in the
original arcade release you'd have to insert real world cash to earn more lives
when you died, in the Steam version you can play with unlimited credits, which
is definitely something I need because you die in one hit here! There's a
Mission Select option that lets you start from any level you want, which is
cool. It also has achievements and Steam trading card support. The action is
non-stop, frantic fun, and I haven't had any issues with this port myself. I've
heard the online multiplayer is broken, but I don't I'll ever use that since
Steam Remote Play Together exists.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

The sprite work is *superb*, and I love the soundtrack too! I don't really mind
if I never play through the entire thing, which is why I don't consider the
Metal Slug Anthology part of my backlog. It's just nice to have this in my
library to play casually from time to time.

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild *(Switch)*    {#TheLegendofZelda:BreathoftheWild}

Breath of the Wild had me feeling several strong emotions this week. I was
enraptured by its beauty, amused by its charm, and frustrated by its gameplay -
or rather, at how my usual Zelda playstyle was failing me here.

<figure class="half center">

Last time, I had reached the gates of Gerudo Town, but Link was not allowed in
because he is a man. Following some rumors about a man who had made it in and
out of the town successfully brought me to Vilia. Vilia suggests Link simply
wear traditional Gerudo clothes, and they'll mistake him for a woman and let him
pass, and offers to sell these clothes to you for 600 rupees. It's a pretty
steep price, but luckily I had plenty of rupees on me and was able to pay it
right away. Link changes into the clothes automatically, and his reaction is
just too cute. Afterward, I returned to Gerudo Town and was allowed entry, just
as Vilia promised.

<figure class="third">

My first order of business was meeting with the Gerudo chief, to come up with a
plan to take back control of the nearby Divine Beast. Though she is still a
child, Riji is chief of the Gerudo. Her and her retainer partially recognize
Link as the Hylian champion of legend, but remark that he might not be the
champion since he's missing the Master Sword. The game drops a hint about where
I should go to find the Master Sword, just as the Zora king did after I defeated
the first Divine Beast. I guess I should really go find it at some point. Before
Riji will offer her aid in defeating Divine Beast Vah Naboris, she tasks Link
with retrieving the Thunder Helm, a Gerudo heirloom that has been stolen by the
Yiga Clan.

<figure class="third">

Thus, I was on my way to the Yiga Clan Hideout. I rented a sand seal, and surfed
blindly through a thick sandstorm that blocked my radar and map while I was
within it. Before long, I made my way through the sandstorm, and reached Yiga
Clan Hideout. This was the first point of frustration for me.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

Stealth segments are nothing new to the Zelda series. Ocarina of Time has you
sneak around guards, Wind Waker has the Forsaken Fortress, and there may be
others I'm forgetting. So this Yiga Clan Hideout segment is nothing strictly
new, and having to watch the Yiga guards' patrol patterns to figure out how to
get past them even reminded me of Ocarina of Time a little bit. What's different
here is that getting caught doesn't just reset you to the beginning of the
dungeon, it simply blocks the path forward and summons a ton of Yiga. Now, you
can fight the Yiga and you may win if you're sufficiently prepared or far in the
game. I was neither of these things. The strong Yiga guards could basically kill
me in a single attack. So getting caught was *really* not fun, because all I
could do is wait for them to kill me...and unfortunately it happened to me
several times. Despite this, I do really like the design of the Hideout. It also
has that unique Nintendo/Zelda charm, in that you can distract the Yiga with
bananas, because they really like bananas. When I finally made it past the
stealth points, I hit what I thought was a dead end, and got a bit frustrated
there too. I had to look up how to proceed, and it turns out I just had to use
the Magnesis rune to rotate a trick wall and reveal the way forward. That made
me feel really stupid, but I guess I just need to try using the runes more. I'm
just not used to having all of Link's abilities available basically from the
beginning of the game. That would come back to haunt me later in the week too.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

Anyway, I retrieved the Thunder Helm by battling Yiga Master Kohga. It was a
pretty simple fight, but I was still feeling frustrated from my struggles
getting through the Hideout, so I didn't really enjoy the fight at the time. I
did really enjoy Kohga's character though, his bumbling and incompetence were
amusing for a leader of the Yiga Clan. I returned the Helm to Riju, and she was
ready to help Link take down the Divine Beast.

</figure>

When we got closer to the Divine Beast, it was Link's job to shoot its feet with
bomb arrows. We approached the towering Beast using sand seals, and I had to
stay close to Riju to remain inside the protective orb of the Thunder Helm. This
was the only way to avoid Vah Naboris's powerful lightning strikes.
Unfortunately, I was hit by one of these, and had a few other close calls...I am
not very good at driving the sand seal with precision. Luckily, I was able to
shoot all 4 feet quickly, and my poor driving didn't matter. With it's feet
wounded, the Divine Beast was brought temporarily to the ground, giving Link an
opportunity to board it.

Like the previous one, this Divine Beast is basically Breath of the Wild's
version of a Zelda dungeon. Once again, I really enjoyed exploring it and
solving its puzzles!

What I did not enjoy was the dungeon boss waiting at the end: Thunderblight
Ganon. I was not prepared for this battle. My weapons kept breaking, which is
perhaps another reason I should retrieve the Master Sword, as I don't think it
will break on me. Also, in its first phase the boss is so fast when it dashes at
you that my strategy was to just block its strikes with my shield, and then
counterattack when it was feeling from the blocked strike. As I said before
though, my weapons kept breaking, and eventually all I had left were spears and
2-handed weapons...and at the time I didn't know you use your shield with those
equipped. So, at the end of the fight I was forced to dodge its lightning-fast
strikes, but I failed a number of times. I ended up pausing *many* times to have
Link wolf down the recipes I'd cooked beforehand. After I ran out of those, I
had him wolf down mushrooms and other ingredients that healed small fractions of
health. That wasn't the worst part for me though. The worst part was the second
phase of the fight, where Thunderblight Ganon drops little pillars into the
ground around you, and summons lightning strikes around them. Dodging these was
no big deal, and my thought was to just shoot the boss with my bow while it was
remained stationary calling down the lightning strikes. Except you can't shoot
it with arrows, because it blocks them with its shield. I wasted a lot of time
and different types of arrows trying to find its weakness here, and even
stupidly didn't understand how to utilize the game's hints when it outright told
me "if only there was a way you could harness the lightning strikes." Another
thing I had to look up online. And again, the solution made me feel extremely
dumb. I could use Magnesis to move the pillars, and I just had to grab one
before a lightning strike hit it and move it by the boss, striking it with its
own lightning attack. I wish I hadn't struggled with that for so long. That was
more difficult for me than any of the strategies needed for bosses in previous
Zelda games, though maybe I just think that because I've played the previous
games several times, and this is still my first Breath of the Wild playthrough.

</figure>

Anyway, despite my struggles and endless complaining, I defeated Thunderblight
Ganon and freed Vah Naboris. This allowed the spirit of Urbosa, the Gerudo
champion, to take control of the Divine Beast once more. Urbosa directed the
Divine Beast to high ground, where it had a clear line of sight to Hyrule
Castle, and began shooting what I assume is some sort of Calamity
Ganon-weakening beam at the castle.

Two Divine Beasts down, two to go. Gerudo Town is now safe, and its time for me
to explore more of Hyrule. There are still *enormous* sections of my map that I
haven't revealed or been to yet. The size of Hyrule in this game is just
amazing. I explored a bit more and activated the towers in two new regions, so
I'm looking forward to exploring those more. Hopefully I'll be more prepared and
struggle less when I reach the next Divine Beast. Also, I don't mean to say
Breath of the Wild is a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. I have
complaints about it, sure, but I feel like it's just a case of me still learning
the ropes, and stubbornly refusing to prepare more before throwing Link at the
next Divine Beast or other trial. Because in past Zelda games, I never had to
gather weapons or food items to prepare. The most preparation I ever did was get
a fairy in a bottle before a boss, just in case. But Breath of the Wild is
different in a lot of ways, so I shouldn't try and play it exactly like the
games that came before it.

I ended the week by visiting the area in one of Link's memory photos, triggering
another Zelda flashback. These cutscenes really highlight how beautiful this
game is, so I'll end this post with a screenshot from this flashback.
