### Soul Hackers 2 *(PS5)*    {#SoulHackers2}

Sometime in the future, the vast sea of humanity's data has given rise to a
sentient digital hivemind called Aion. Aion exists as an observer of humanity,
learning from watching the world but never interfering in it directly. However,
when Aion calculates an impending apocalypse, it is forced to take action. Aion
creates two agents to intervene directly with the human world: Ringo, and Figue.
Their mission: stop the apocalypse, and save the world.

Soul Hackers 2 is a 2022 JRPG from Atlus. I played it on PS5, but it's also
available on PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and PC. It's a spin-off of the Megami
Tensei series, and serves as a loose sequel to Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers,
which originally released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and was ported to the
Nintendo 3DS and released in English for the first time in 2013. You don't need
to have played that first game to enjoy Soul Hackers 2 though. In terms of
overall feel, I'd say it lands somewhere in the middle between Persona and Shin
Megami Tensei. You fight with a team of human party members in battle, but
there's a heavier focus on gameplay rather than story. The presentation is also
*very* stylish, like the smooth transitions to battles where Ringo brandishes
her sword and sweeps across the screen.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

Though the story takes a backseat compared to the gameplay, it is still quite
good. In the beginning, Ringo starts by trying to track down a few key
individuals who will be important in preventing the end of the world: Arrow,
Milady, and Saizo. However, by the time Ringo catches up to each of them,
they're already dead. She doesn't let that stop her though, and uses a power
called Soul Hacking to bring each of them back to life. Alongside her three new
allies, Ringo begins to investigate how they can prevent the impending
apocalypse. It's a good setup to the story, and while the plot is pretty basic
for a while afterward, it becomes much more interesting around the halfway
point.

One of my favorite parts of the gameplay was the turn-based combat. Though it
doesn't use the Press Turn or One More systems from SMT or Persona, it's still
really fun. Instead, battles use the Sabbath system, where hitting enemy
weaknesses adds to the Stack. The higher Stack you have the more bonus damage
you'll do with an extra attack from your demons at the end of your turn. Unlike
in SMT, there's really not much of a penalty when an enemy attacks your
weakness; the attack deals more damage than usual, but that's it. It's
definitely a more straightforward battle system than SMT, but it still
encourages you to hit enemy weaknesses, which I've always enjoyed in these
games. There's also a lot of party banter during battles. Your teammates will
have something to say about pretty much everything you do. I wasn't sure how I
felt about this chattiness in the beginning, but it really grew on me, and I
like how it allows the characters' personalities to shine during battle. Seeing
the demons was also really cool. They look great, and while I was familiar with
most of them from other MegaTen games, there were a few I'd never heard of
before, like Turbo Granny.

</figure>

Recruiting demons uses a very simplified version of the negotiation system from
SMT. You also don't recruit them during battle; instead, you send your current
demons out to perform Demon Recon when you enter each dungeon. Then you'll find
them standing around the dungeon waiting for you, and they'll give you items,
heal you, or give you a chance to recruit a new demon. The recruitment process
consists of just a single request from the demon, usually for money or an item,
and if you're able to give it to them, they'll join you. Brief as these
negotiations are, it was still nice to see them included in some capacity
because it's always amusing to see what some demons will say.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

You equip demons you've recruited to Ringo and the rest of your party to change
their resistances, attacks, and stat bonuses. Interestingly, you can't switch
demons during battle at the beginning of the game. I was really confused by this
at first, and thought it was maybe an effort to add strategy, like encouraging
you to always have a balanced party of demons equipped so you don't get
blind-sided by an enemy with resistances you aren't prepared for. But once you
unlock the Commander Skill "Conversion" around the time of the 2nd main story
dungeon, you're able to change demons during battle, but you can only change one
party member's demon per turn at first, although later on you get the "Master
Conversion" skill which allows you to change the whole party's demons at once.

</figure>

Demon fusion is also present, and functions very similarly to how it does in
Persona and SMT. You take two demons and fuse them together to create a new
demon that inherits some of the skills of the demons that went into it. At
first, you only have four skill slots for your demons, which felt *really*
restrictive and I always struggled to decide which skills to keep during fusion
when I had more than four options. Later on you can unlock Summoner Skills for
Ringo that give you a fifth skill slot on your demons, and then eventually a
sixth skill slot. Having five skill slots available was *much* nicer, but even
with six skill slots it's still fewer than I'm used to having from other MegaTen
games. In any case, I always enjoy the fusion mechanics in these games. Trying
to fuse strong demons is always a lot of fun, especially when you're able to
create a demon that has no weaknesses by having it inherit the right passive
skills. There's also a good number of demons in the game, and I like to try to
fuse as many as possible, so it was fun coming back to see what new demons I
could fuse whenever I leveled up.

Soul Hackers 2 also looks and sounds great. The soundtrack is really good,
ranging from crunchy guitar tracks to smooth electric piano ones. Character
sprites and models look fantastic. The characters are cel-shaded, but some
textures have a slight water color look, which looks really nice and keeps them
from looking flat. The character sprites that appear during dialogue also have a
lot of different expressions, and they'll change mid-sentence to fit the emotion
of the scene too. It's a really nice touch, and helps breath more life into
these characters. There's a sprite of Ringo where she's smirking, and it is the
absolute best.

A large part of the gameplay is the dungeon crawling, which reminds me a bit of
Shin Megami Tensei IV. There's no random encounters, which I appreciated.
Instead, enemies appear as distorted figures as you explore, and will chase you
for a while if they see you, starting a battle if they catch you. You can either
run or hit them with your sword to knock them down, causing them to despawn
after a few seconds, or giving you a chance at free bonus damage at the start of
battle if you run into them while they're knocked down. The dungeons are pretty
basic, but occasionally feature small puzzles/gimmicks. It doesn't hold your
hand to solve them either, there's no forced dialog from companions guiding you
toward the solution. It's all up to the player to figure out how to proceed by
exploring carefully and examining the map when needed. I really like this
hands-off approach, it feels very true to SMT.

</figure>

There's two separate dungeon crawling experiences here: the main story dungeons,
and the Soul Matrix. The Soul Matrix is optional for the most part, and serves
as a secondary dungeon you can explore at your own pace, though you will get
blocked off at certain points based on main story progress. The main story
dungeons are pretty short compared to the Soul Matrix. The Soul Matrix is split
into three separate dungeons, one for each member of your party besides Ringo,
and each one has five floors, each of which is rather long. Making your way
through the Soul Matrix can be a little tiring due to all this, especially since
the floors and dungeons all look the same. It would have been nice if the floors
had something to differentiate them visually, or maybe something to
differentiate dungeons by character. In any case, since you are free to tackle
the Soul Matrix at your own pace, I tried to do it in small bursts so I didn't
get burnt out on it, and it was fun when I managed to stick to this routine. I
wouldn't have minded if the story dungeons had been longer and the Soul Matrix
shorter though.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

The final dungeon also could have been a little longer. The parts that were
there were cool, and when I started it I thought to myself, "this is the best
dungeon in the game," but I was a little underwhelmed when I reached the end of
it. I wish it had been longer and featured more mini-bosses along the way. It
had a few bosses in the middle, and these were really cool, but I wouldn't have
minded some more mini-bosses along the way. You know, pit me against a few cool
high level demons or something, like Saturnus or a few of the archangels. The
final dungeon just didn't have the *impact* that I've come to expect from final
dungeons in MegaTen games. It pales in comparison to final dungeons in other
spin-off games like Digital Devil Saga.

Without spoiling the story, I will say there are multiple endings here. In
general, the Soul Matrix is optional, though the main story does take you there
a little bit. However, if you want to get one of the endings, you need to have
cleared floors 1 through 4 of everyone's Soul Matrix dungeons. Progressing
through the dungeons requires you to meet certain Soul Level thresholds with
that character. Soul Level is a concept introduced early on, where you gain
points towards a character's Soul Level based on your dialogue choices in some
of the cutscenes. It shows you exactly whose Soul Level will increase and by how
much when you're making the choices, which helps you keep their Soul Levels
balanced. In order to clear the floors needed for this ending, you need to have
at least 100 Soul Level with each character. You can do this in your first
playthrough if you're careful about your dialogue choices, and I was pretty
careful, *but* I still ended up 1 point short with Arrow. He was stuck on 99
Soul Level when I first finished the game, and it was only after that I learned
about the multiple endings. I loaded up my last save before the end of the game,
and started scrambling to figure out how to get that last Soul Level point. My
save file was already past all the dialogue choices that give Soul Level points,
so I needed another option. Throughout the game, after meeting certain
conditions you unlock Hangout Events with your party members and you can meet
them for drinks at the bar for a short conversation with them, and usually a
Soul Level point or two. These usually unlock after completing specific side
quests, and you'll meet your party and have a short scene talking about that
quest. Luckily, I was able to unlock one of these Hangout Events for my whole
party by completing a side quest I'd missed. With that, Arrow reached 100 Soul
Level, I was able to complete the 4th floor of his Soul Matrix dungeon, finish
the game again, and get the ending I was shooting for. That might all sound a
little tedious, but I actually enjoyed figuring it out, and I enjoyed this
ending a lot more, personally.

The English voice cast again featured several familiar voices. This is another
game where Cup of Tea productions handled the English voice acting. Megan Taylor
Harvey, who voiced Hanabi in Scarlet Nexus, voices Ringo in this game and she
does a fantastic job. There's also several other voice actors I've heard in
previous games (see below for a few examples), and listening to them bring these
characters to life in English was wonderful.

A few random tips if you're playing Soul Hackers 2 yourself: first, increase the
text speed. "Default" is way too slow, the voice lines will often outpace the
text appearing on screen, and this was really annoying in the opening of the
game! I increased the text speed as soon as I had access to the options menu
after starting the game, and it feels *much* better set to "Fast" speed. Also,
you'll want to change the setting for loading screen tips. With loading screen
tips set to the default "Auto Advance" setting, the game artifically increases
the loading time so you have time to read the tip on-screen. Luckily, you can
turn the tips off or set them to require a button press to advance. Both
settings remove the artificially inflated load time, and this can *drastically*
improve loading times depending on the platform you're playing on which really
improves the experience.

Despite my complaints, I had a lot of fun playing Soul Hackers 2. It's not a
perfect game and there's a number of things that could be improved, but it also
has elements and moments that are really great. If you've already played and
enjoyed a bunch of other games in the MegaTen franchise, then I'd definitely
recommend Soul Hackers 2. Or, if you're a diehard RPG fan, then Soul Hackers 2
is also worth a shot. I hope Atlus makes more spin-offs like this, they used to
make a lot more MegaTen spin-offs during the PS2 era, like the Raidou and
Digital Devil Saga games, and it'd be really cool if they started doing that
again. Anyway, my final time for this one was 43 hours 20 minutes.
