### Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King *(3DS)*    {#DragonQuestVIII:JourneyoftheCursedKing}

I started my first Dragon Quest game this week, Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of
the Cursed King on 3DS! This is an enhanced version of Dragon Quest VIII, which
originally released for PS2 in 2005 in North America.

This is a very traditional RPG with some nice quality of life options. You
explore towns and dungeons, fight turn-based battle to gain experience and
levels, manage your equipment, and all the usual RPG trappings. One thing I like
about this remake is that it doesn't have random encounters, and instead has
enemies appear in the overworld. I still try to battle many of the monsters I
see so my team maintains proper levels, but it's nice to be able to avoid battle
when I want to focus on getting to the next location or something. Some of the
nice quality of life stuff includes an Auto Heal option you can use from the
field, which will automatically have your party members cast healing spells to
heal the whole party most efficiently. You also get access to the spell Zoom
very early, which allows you to instantly teleport to locations you've
previously visited. This kind of thing usually seems to show up late in the game
in most RPGs, so having access to it basically from the beginning of the game is
really refreshing.

The story here is pretty simple. You play as a heroic character that you name,
so naturally I named my hero Worm. Worm is trying to help the monstrous looking
King Trode and his daughter Medea, who have been turned into a troll and a horse
respectively. The one who cast this spell is the evil jester Dhoulmagus, and the
party pursues him in hopes to restore Trode and Medea to their original forms.
Trode and Medea travel with your party, with Trode offering advice on where to
go next to advance the plot, and Medea pulling the party's wagon. Naturally, the
two of them don't participate in battle. In the beginning, your only fighters
are the hero and Yangus, but eventually the group expands to include Jessica and
Angelo as well.

I really like this party of four. For one thing, everyone except Jessica knows
at least some level of Heal spell. Maybe Jessica learns one later, but even if
she doesn't, having 3 out of 4 characters capable of using healing magic is
really useful. There's considerable customization for the team too. As your
characters level up, they gain skill points that you can put into various
categories based on how you want them to fight. Several of the categories for
each character are for different types of weapons, and I've been dumping points
into only 1 of these for each character based on what I've decided they should
mainly wield. Each character also has a skill point category that is unique to
them, like the hero's Courage, or Jessica's Sex Appeal.

[![set the whole party to Fight Wisely](https://i.imgur.com/ln9o4sHm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/ln9o4sH.png)

In battle with common enemies, I usually put things on auto-battle using the
Tactics option. This allows you to have the AI choose commands for as many party
members as you want, so I usually just set the whole party to Fight Wisely and
let things go, and turn on the super speed option to speed up battle animations.
That might sound boring or like a waste of time. Why would I play this game if I
didn't want to actually *fight* the battles, right? But it's weirdly relaxing to
watch, and kind of fun to see what spells and abilities the AI picks actually.
It's not like the battle system isn't fun, and for boss battles I take direct
control, but I really appreciate the Tactics option.

This game is super charming, the character and enemy designs by Akira Toriyama
are superb. I'm also playing with a fan-made orchestral sound patch that swaps
the MIDI music with official orchestral recordings of the same songs. I believe
the orchestral versions were present in the Japanese 3DS release, but were taken
out for international versions for some reason, so this patch just restores
them. It sounds quite nice! Dragon Quest VIII has a ton to offer, and this 3DS
version builds on top of the original game by adding even more stuff, like a
photo mode with a bunch of optional photo challenges to complete. I'm over 10
hours in, and I don't even think I'm very far. This a great game for that
traditional RPG fix, and I'm really glad to have finally started this game and
this series!

### A Hat in Time *(PC)*    {#AHatinTime}

Starting just one super cute game this week wasn't enough for me I guess,
because I started playing this self-described "cute-as-heck" 3D platformer too!

<figure class="half">
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cOAyjLp.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cOAyjLpm.jpg" alt="this"/></a>
    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ICjBzNT.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ICjBzNTm.jpg" alt="3D platformer"/></a>
</figure>

This game is a basically an indie Super Mario 64 or Super Mario Sunshine, with
some Banjo-Kazooie type elements too. The story is about as involved and
important as in those games too. It's a simple setup where Hat Kid's spaceship
is attacked by the mafia as she passes near the planet Mafia Town is on, and
after the Mafia forces their way onto the ship, her stash of Time Pieces is
lost, falling down to the planet's surface. The Time Pieces power her ship, and
she's stuck without them. Hat Kid has no choice but to scour Mafia Town and the
rest of the planet to recover the missing Time Pieces, with the player
controlling her on her journey.

<figure class="half">

    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/h2BLhXK.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h2BLhXKm.jpg" alt="her stash of Time Pieces is lost"/></a>
</figure>

The level structure here is *incredibly* similar to the pre-Odyssey 3D Mario
platformers. Each "Chapter" is a different location on the planet with its own
aesthetic, and the Chapters are split into "Acts," which are levels that take
place in the same world but with different areas blocked off and different
conditions affecting the world depending on the level. You access the Chapters
from telescopes scattered around Hat Kid's ship, which serves as the central
hub, and as you gather more Time Pieces you gain access to more areas of the
ship and more Chapters. Like I said, very similar to 3D Mario platformers!

</figure>

What sets A Hat in Time apart from the 3D Mario games in my opinion is that its
humor and situations are zanier than the ones seen in most Mario levels, and
that there's a higher degree of experimentation with some of the Acts. For
instance, one Act is a murder mystery on a train, where you have to platform and
sneak around to recover evidence that points to the murderer. Another kind of
reminded me of the progression system of Luigi's Mansion, where you have to
collect keys to advance through a dark and spooky manor. One entire Chapter
mixes the normal formula on its head, and gives you a whole open world to
explore non-linearly to find several Time Pieces within it, tackling each of
them in whatever order you please. The experimentation with these levels is very
successful in my opinion, and the variety is quite nice.

</figure>

Besides the Time Pieces, there are also other collectibles in many of the
levels, like the balls of Yarn. You need to collect at least some number of
these in order to stitch new hats that grant new powers that may be required to
advance through later levels, but which Yarns you collect is up to you as long
as you collect enough to stitch the hats you need. Besides the Yarns, other
collectibles include Rift Tokens that give you non-essential cosmetic upgrades
or alternate music tracks, and Relics that allow access to challenge levels.

I'm having a lot of fun with A Hat in Time! It's a solid 3D platformer.
Collecting Time Pieces is a whole lot of fun, and definitely scratches the same
itch as something like collecting Shine Sprites in Super Mario Sunshine does.
